RUUJJA0TERA67,B096SV8SJG,5.0 out of 5 stars Compared to 4 other Earbuds...,Connor,5,"I bought these earbuds along with 4 other pairs, with the intent of comparing them over a couple weeks and returning all but my favorite. Here were the results:Beats Fit Pro - https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09JL65GNM?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_detailsPros – These buds had some great base, and the wingtip gave them a fit that made them refuse to fall out of my ears. But the best feature? Physical “clicky” buttons on each one of the buds. You press in and hear/feel the click, rather than relying on a touchscreen-like feature. No need to guess if you tapped them once or twice, you will know.Cons – The wingtip gives a very sturdy fit, but not the most comfortable. I wouldn’t recommend to anyone with smaller ears. The noise canceling was solid, but nothing special. And this may be picky, but I didn’t care for most of the color schemes available. I prefer my earbuds to be hard to notice, and even the black ones have a bright red letter “b” in the middle.Beats Studio Buds - https://www.amazon.com/dp/B096SV8SJG?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_detailsPros – Very comfortable with the same great physically “clicky” buttons as the Beats Fit Pro. Noise canceling seemed slightly better than average. Great base. Classic look.Cons – Tested during a workout, a little bit of sweat had these sliding right out of my ear. The case for these earbuds also was the flimsiest of any I had tested, with a very weak hinge that I was scared of breaking off within the 2 weeks of using.Samsung Galaxy Buds Pro - https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08MWZHHKP?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_detailsPros – A neat feature that I noticed only in these earbuds was that it had noise amplification as well as noise cancelation. With one swipe in the app, the surrounding sound was actually louder and clearer than it would be without the earbuds in. Great if you are hard of hearing, or just enjoy snooping on conversations out of reach.Cons – Similar to the Beats Studio Buds, these didn’t stay in during a workout. They were usable, but every 10 minutes I found myself pushing them back into my ear. And this is an opinion, but these are the ugliest earbuds out of the bunch. The shiny black gleam made it look like a large beetle was hanging out in my ear. No visible brand placement either, which makes them appear cheap and generic rather than the quality Samsung they are.Samsung Galaxy Buds Live - https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09TBM1L3S?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_detailsPros – Cost effective! I added these to the test group because of the unique shape, and for that they are worth giving a try. If you have small ears and do not like the rubber insert that is standard in most other earbuds, these may be perfect for you.Cons – Poor fit for large ears. These were tested the least of all of the buds, because the fit was so bad for my ear shape that they wouldn’t stay in if I turned my head too fast.Bose QuietComfort - https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08C4KWM9T?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_detailsPros – Bose noise canceling is unmatched. If your primary use for earbuds is to cancel out that background white noise, this is the pair for you. The sound quality is great, not too heavy on the base. The case for the earbuds stood out from the rest as the only one that impressed me. Felt very study, and I had no worries tossing it into a gym bag or cup holder. The only case with a button latch to make sure it doesn’t open accidentally.Cons – This was the most expensive pair of earbuds by a longshot, and there were still some things I felt could be improved. The rubber inserts had more of a “flayed” shape rather than the “rounded” shape that is standard. My guess is that this was by design, because the earbuds were also slightly heavier than others and may need that extra in-ear grip. The flayed shape did make them sturdier, but at the cost of them being uncomfortable in an active situation. They were also the largest earbuds, and stuck out from the side of my head further than I would have liked.My favorite? The beats fit pro! While I wouldn’t recommend this pair for everyone, it was perfect for my routine. My music taste benefits from the boosted base, and the wingtip shape was perfect for any workouts. The feature that really convinced me was the physical buttons, something that I didn’t realize how desperately I needed.","Reviewed in the United States August 11, 2022",AFEITP6Y25NKH3KB2LXWQCC7STIA,1,2277,Color: BlackStyle: Studio BudsSet: Without AppleCare+,Beats Studio Buds,0.16530880230880232,0.5307694003527337,Neutral
R3EO2GBST2UICI,B096SV8SJG,5.0 out of 5 stars Initial review and comparison to other brands,philip seitz,5,"I love these earbuds. They feel definitely worth the price and a all around great buy. Giving me exactly what I was looking for.For years I have used the raycon E55 and some of the features I loved about raycon was the manual button in the earbuds, excessive bass and great inside-ear fit.Recently however, raycon has gone the way of the world— they have put sensors on the earbuds in the place of buttons and Balanced out the audio. So I began my search for new earbuds.—THE SOUND—Both the AirPods, galaxybuds and raycons I have tried tend to be balanced and prioritize giving equal notes to all instruments For a clear and concise sound, But to someone who is not an audiophile it sounds very flat and devoid of the punch that I desire. For me- I want it to be great sounding but also noticeably bass heavy. These Beats Studio buds deliver. The company recognizes that your not using these to analyze a song. These are for the people who like bass and want to feel some gravitas in their ears!—CONNECTIVITY—These connect effortlessly to iPhone, as if they were AirPods. It was the single biggest factor that blew me away with these. They are incredibly easy to connect. I cannot speak for android but these work great. They do not have a lot of audio adjustments like Bose but I frankly don’t need them to. You can easily see the battery state on both buds and the case from a pop up window in your apple home screen whenever opening the case, just like AirPods.—FIT—The fit is not as good as the raycon E55 but only by a little bit. They fit snuggly in your ears well enough that they do not fall off when running and working out. Although adjustments might need to be made to them occasionally. (I have small ears, so the fit is review as such)—THE CONTROLS—The controls are simple and straightforward. They are just like what you come to expect from earbuds. Single tap, double tap, triple tap.The earbuds HAVE AN ACTUAL BUTTON… which I thought was extinct, I personally hate the sensor buttons because adjusting your earbuds in your ears would trigger the controls.While these do have a very sensitive physical button— it is easy to avoid while adjusting with practice.—BATTERY—The battery lasts me all day, what more do you want?—RANGE—Very good, about 30+ feet—CONS—-no MagSafe compatible charging-fit isn’t as perfect as some brands but is really good-if your an audiophile these earbuds are not balancedFinal call-If you like bass, and hate the sensor controls on most earbuds— these very well could be the best earbuds you could get. These are on par with earbuds in the 200$ range. And if your anything like me, you will love them! And if not, they might still be worth it to you—UPDATE—they have a hard time staying in when working out, and so I had to buy wing tips for these. They automatically have active noise cancellation on when you take them out of the case… which I personally hate.And the cases battery is pretty short lived… only lasts two days generally","Reviewed in the United States September 28, 2023",AFMDCDCHBIWSEI6RDYBCY4MXXVZQ,1,562,Color: BlackStyle: Studio BudsSet: Without AppleCare+,Beats Studio Buds,0.17547510822510823,0.5111769480519481,Neutral
R2D114QWXW4IOU,B096SV8SJG,5.0 out of 5 stars I think they’re great,Maizy,5,"I like the sound a lot. I read a previous review from someone saying that the audio sounds really quiet at first and to fix it go into the setting for your headphones and change the press and hold feature to change the volume, after you use the headphones to turn the volume up, you can switch that setting off back to noise control. After i did that the audio was great, nice and loud. The buds fit nice for me with the small ear tips, not uncomfortable. The case is pretty light as well which i personally like a lot. Pretty solid headphones, I quite like them. The noise cancellation doesn’t entirely work, but i dont really mind too much since it still blocks out some noise just not entirely.Solid headphones, worth it :)","Reviewed in the United States July 27, 2024",AFRVRGYJJSBAELQK6XVCXXBCJXLA,1,3,Color: BlackStyle: Studio BudsSet: Without AppleCare+,Beats Studio Buds,0.23106060606060605,0.5367424242424241,Positive
R29LYUZ7DI2CS6,B096SV8SJG,"4.0 out of 5 stars Quality sound and build, BUT...",Everest,4,"After using these for a couple weeks straight, I think it's time to review.I would like to state upfront that I bought these on sale for $75. I bought the black ones because the pink ones weren't on sale.Let's start with some pros:The sound is very good, just about on par with my IEMs. These are definitely catered towards more bassy genres, but in the case of metal, I like being able to hear bass along side lead, and provides some heavy kicks. The physical button instead of just touch is an odd choice, but it works. The package comes with a free trial of Apple music (which I will never use), as well as a tiny usb-c to usb-c charger (so hopefully you have a spare usb-c block), and 3 different sized tips, small, meduim, and large. These have awareness mode, as well as a noise isolation mode. Awareness mode is nice, but noise isolation causes me to have a headache.Now some cons:This may be just my ears, but the small tip is too small, and the medium is just big enough to still be pushed out. The body is very smooth, and if you're someone that produces a lot of earwax (like me), it won't stay put and the only thing keeping it in is the tips, meaning you have to keep pushing them back in, and bumping the button. These sit in a very specific position, but don't really like to stay there. Because of the sound mostly being catered towards bass, some leads and vocals can sound a bit muddy at times. By default, the case doesn't have a loop for a string to hold on to and the case is very smooth, so you have to buy a third party case and put it over the stock case just to make it easier to hold on to. These come with an app, and it's very lackluster. No equalizer, there's a find earbuds feature but I'm pretty sure it's not GPS, and you can't mess with settings if the earbuds aren't connected, not to mention: why do my earbuds need to update?!In conclusion: these are good earbuds and I recommend them, but ONLY IF THEY'RE ON SALE.These are 100% worth the $75 I spent on them, but NO WAY ARE THEY WORTH THE $150 RETAIL PRICE TAG.","Reviewed in the United States August 3, 2024",AEDBORE5CT34E6D7QVXFZW5ZERCA,1,0,Color: BlackStyle: Studio BudsSet: Without AppleCare+,Beats Studio Buds,0.15609410430839002,0.45681311413454295,Neutral

Wasn't expecting it to be that different. But, alas, it is. Now with that said, these here are super affordable. If you're on a budget get them.

R3OTWPP01KM2BY,B096SV8SJG,3.0 out of 5 stars actually disappointing,kimmy,3,"bought these after my airpod pros died on me suddenly. i have been using these beats studio buds for about 6 months and the experience has been inconsistent to say the least. first issue: they fall out of my ears if i do simple things like turn my head or chew. i can barely walk or exercise with them in because they just fall out. i looked online and it seems others have had these issues; people were suggesting swapping the size of the actual ear bud and even wearing them in reverse (with the left bud in the right ear and right bud in left ear). neither if these worked for me. really made me appreciate the airpod design.it was fairly easy to connect the very first time but every time after that is almost always a pain. if the case is dead but the beats themselves are still charged it’s like it doesn't recognize that the beats are still working and refuses to connect. even if the case is charged sometimes it just will not recognize that the beats are in range of my phone, even if they're sitting right on top of each other. if it’s not straight up refusing to connect it’s disconnecting randomly. if i open my car door - even with the car turned off - the beats automatically disconnect from my phone as if it expects me to connect my phone to carplay. there are many times i have been talking on the phone using my beats and suddenly they will disconnect.the controls only kind of work. you can use the default preset controls like pressing twice for skipping songs and once for hanging up calls and the like. however you're supposed to be able to customize these controls to in your phone settings but they only work as long as the beats are disconnected. as soon as you put the beats away and disconnect everything goes back to default settings the next time you reconnect. noise cancellation is a joke, it sounds the same as when its on transparent mode or off.the case feels like cheap plastic. i got a silicone case because i was afraid of scratching it up. not much else to say about it.the color of the beats are great. i got red and it looks super cool. i think the sound quality is on par with my old airpod pros. when i am on the phone others have not had a problem with not hearing me or me coming across muffled, so that’s a plus.overall, these earbuds are nothing special. i got these around the holidays when they were almost half off. glad i didn’t pay full price for these as they are disappointing at best.ETA: as of july 2024 i ditched these and bought another pair of airpod pros. literally no regrets.","Reviewed in the United States May 25, 2024",AFSUYJ3N2JAFCBPFF7G6VM5LLT5A,1,65,Color: RedStyle: Studio BudsSet: Without AppleCare+,Beats Studio Buds,0.12759740259740257,0.448728354978355,Neutral
R3MCOYFNYISC7D,B096SV8SJG,5.0 out of 5 stars Bought for fiance and she loves them.,alex,5,Fiance loves them. She isn't very techy but she really likes the sound quality of these. I'm no audiophile but they sound great for the price I paid. They are comfortable and light. They look great but the case is big. The mic isn't too good but works when needed. The color is really what I got them for. She loves pink. She has really small ears and the headphone ear plugs that came with these were all too big. We swapped them out a few months later and haven't heard anything about it yet from her. So I'm assuming they are working great. She dropped one into the sink and they were soaked and stopped working for a few days I riced them and blowdried them and they came back to life. Still sound as good as ever. Wasn't expecting that from these. 5 stars fr. Nice job Apple.

R2MOD3AIAL0RCQ,B096SV8SJG,"4.0 out of 5 stars Pretty good. Not GREAT, but not bad.",Papa Boots,4,"Whenever I see something with a 4-star review, it usually means it’s a solid product but there’s something (or somethings) keeping it out of 5-star range.For me, these are a perfect example of that. They’re small (good), not terribly obtrusive (only some out-of-ear-stick-out, tho your experience may vary), the sound has some solid bass which is helpful for the gym (where I tested these out), the sound overall is clear (download some equalizer apps to play with the sound itself), and they stayed in my ear well. I don’t know much about soundstage or whatever, but the sound itself is clear, bass is nice and strong, and you can hear even the subtle nuances like the shifting of a hand on guitar strings clearly enough without being disturbed. That, to me, is the sign of a good earbud.The transparency mode and noise canceling modes were alright. But that’s just it, they’re alright. Granted, the AirPod Pros have a higher price tag, so they do the ANC and Transparency mode much better. So it’s understandable that these would do the same, but on just the slightest bit of a lower level.I’m also spoiled bc the Airpod Pros have wireless charging. These DO have USB C, but the lack of wireless charging is a small thing, really. There’s something about being able to toss these on a charging pad and leaving them there to charge that’s just so satisfying. Also, was not a fan of how the case just doesn’t have that “premium” feel. The matte finish is nice, tho I would have liked a little more weight in the case lid, but at this point, these are such little (and I mean LITTLE) things that really, it’s not a dealbreaker.My only thing is the amount they stick out. I’m sorry, but they do look a little…funny, the way they sort of stick out just a bit so that the “b” logo is upright. They don’t stick out a LOT, but juuuuust enough that when you look in the mirror, you’ll see a vertical line where the physical button (which I have managed to press on accident a couple of times while adjusting the bud) sticks out. Also, I had a little difficulty getting them to stay in, but that’s beyond pretty much anyone’s control.These get that 4th star because of just how they are a solid enough product worth the purchase. They don’t do any one thing particularly well, but there are just enough teeny things for me that I wouldn’t say these are the best I’ve ever used. (For comparison, the Jabra 75t gets the equivalent of a 4.3 rating…the hear-through is amazing and their app really helps boost functionality).For me, these are SOLID gym earbuds. They play music loudly, clearly enough, and the bass is strong enough for me that I can drown out whatever annoying other music is playing outside. They fit and stay relatively well. For the price tag, you get some good bang for the buck. You could do worse, but at this range, depending on if you want to pitch in a few more, you could also do better.","Reviewed in the United States June 27, 2021",AECTDFXXCI5RLPDMMXH2ELH4LJVA,1,1697,Color: RedStyle: Studio BudsSet: Without AppleCare+,Beats Studio Buds,0.14655797101449272,0.4858264320220842,Neutral
R3W44HXR3GUPIE,B096SV8SJG,4.0 out of 5 stars Makes sense for price.,Bee,4,"I am not a sound junkie, so take my review as someone who knows nothing about specs, quality, etc.Performance wise, they do what I expect them to do. They play my music. The buds do not have ear detection, so you have to press play/pause anytime something interrupts you. The sound was also very low when I received them, as they were a used product, but a little configuration in my settings fixed that immediately. I had no issues pairing them. I do like that you can see battery level without opening the case, you just go to your bluetooth icon and it’s there for both buds plus case.They’re not great at noise cancelling if I had to compare to say, AirPod pros. They’re more noise reducing, so if that’s your driving point with these you will not get what you are looking for. They do utilize spatial audio too, but again it’s just enough to say it’s there.Comfort wise, I like how they fit in my ear. Downside if I am working out they will fall out if I start sweating. They have squishy tips though which I do enjoy.Putting them in the case can be confusing. If you drop the case they will fly out though. Upside to that, these bad boys have survived my washer and dryer three times so far with no hit to the existing quality of sound or performance.Appearance wise they are really small, if you have long hair you could easily hide these during whatever you are doing.I got the black color, pretty standard. Nothing too different than what’s pictured.They’re extremely lightweight too (reference back to dropping the case) so I do suggest a protective case if you need some weight to it. I can honestly forget them in my pockets from how light they are.","Reviewed in the United States July 24, 2024",AHPNYX3N7YSFKEGN2VREBPXEGT7A,1,0,Color: BlackStyle: Studio BudsSet: Without AppleCare+,Beats Studio Buds,0.146577380952381,0.5847619047619049,Neutral
R2FJ02IAUY08JQ,B096SV8SJG,3.0 out of 5 stars Not Worth the Hype: Disappointing Features Despite Good Sound Quality,KFCC,3,"**Review:**I really wanted to like these, but after using them for almost a week, I find them poor in everything except for the relatively good sound when playing music. They are absolutely unusable for my work, which involves video conferencing. This is a deal-breaker.**Pros:**- Sound Quality: The mids are nice and clear, and the bass is tight and punchy when the volume is turned up. When listening to the right kind of music at high volumes, they can sound downright amazing. I appreciate the trueness of the sound, especially given my diverse music tastes from reggae to hip hop, jazz, R&B, and EDM.- Fit: They sit very snug in my ears, effectively blocking out external sounds, which provides a passive noise-canceling effect.**Cons:**- Noise Cancelling and Transparency Modes: Both modes fall short of expectations. Transparency mode, which should let you hear your surroundings, instead adds a hollow reverb and doesn't work well; I couldn’t even hear someone talking directly to me while using it. Noise cancellation mode introduces a persistent noise layer, similar to wind or the sea, rather than effectively blocking external sounds.- Controls: The physical buttons are a matter of personal preference. For me, they are frustrating and cumbersome, often leading to accidental pausing of the music, restarting the track, or skipping to the previous track. I find touch-sensitive controls more intuitive. Maybe I'll get used to it over time, but currently, it’s quite inconvenient.- Bluetooth Range: Disappointingly low with frequent disconnections even at moderate distances. To be honest, they perform similarly to the Earfun Air Pro 3, but I expected them to be better. Maybe I need to cut them some slack since they're a year older (2021) than the Earfun Air Pro 3.- Microphone Quality: Sounds horrible and robotic on a PC, making it unusable for video conferencing or recordings. I need to test the call quality on mobile.**Conclusion:**Overall, I'm not convinced these earbuds live up to the hype or their price. Despite impressive sound quality and numerous positive reviews, I want to be objective and make an informed decision. Here are the questions I’m considering:- Am I being more critical because of the price?- Is the fact that the normal mode sounds amazing with the passive noise-canceling from the fit enough to overlook the underwhelming or broken modes?- Should I use these earbuds just for music and avoid using them for work, which heavily relies on video conferencing on PC?- Will the microphone performance be better on mobile?- Will the fit remain as good when working out or sweating?- What will happen if they fall into a puddle of water?- Can they handle 8 hours of continuous work without causing fatigue?I realize that I can’t fully trust online reviews, particularly with notable brands where reviewers might be enamoured by the brand itself or the product’s popularity. This can lead to mismatched expectations between what is advertised and what actually meets my needs. I’ll continue to test these earbuds in various scenarios to make a more informed decision.","Reviewed in the United States July 24, 2024",AEMRF56YHKNWCKBIVLXZTGEV753A,1,0,Color: RedStyle: Studio BudsSet: Without AppleCare+,Beats Studio Buds,0.1696582710219074,0.5025213170667715,Neutral

These headphones are, in fact, a cut above their competitors at cheaper levels. These things connect seamlessly with my Galaxy s23, and are pretty much rolling by the time you slide them in your ear. On that note, they do tend to wiggle out under any real activity (constantly adjust in the gym, definitely gonna fall out in SE Louisiana heat this time of year, luckily i could hear them when i put my ear to the grass to find them, so dont work outside with em.Overall i am impressed and kinda just kicking myself for not spending even more for a better fitting pair of buds.

Aesthetically, he quality of the product is good, arrived clean, in the original box with charger and manuals. I like the design of the case (small enough to tuck away but big enough to keep track of.) 10/10. The headphones performance though are just ok and that's coming from a long time Beats fan. I bought these specifically because I lost one of my Beats Fit Pro pods (special edition ones that I can't get replaced or don't want to pay 2/3 the cost to do), anyway, these were an affordable backup. Sadly, these particular beats are lacking in sound quality, battery life, and noise cancellation.-Sound quality: 6.5/10 overall for sound with music. The sounds is quite low, volume on the device playing needs to be almost at max to hear comfortably for phone calls or audio/podcasts. Expected more oomph like my other sets.- Battery Life: 6/10. I charged them fully the first night and used them for a 1hr workout and for a few hours of a work shift. The case and headphones were completely dead the next morning without charge. So only one full day of use on a charge which again is starkly different from my Beats Fit Pros that lasted for up to 5-7 days without needing another charge. Boo.Noise Cancellation: 4/10 Probably the most obvious and my least favorite feature of these headphones is the noise cancellation. Even with one headphone in, you can hear absolutely nothing in the surroundings. I know some would love this, but other Beats models have the ambient sound option that allows you to hear the headphone audio AND the surrounding area comfortable. I feel like I'm wearing a hearing aid with these.One perk: Unlike other beats these headphones are interchangeable (at least for me). I was able to swap ears which is nice.Overall Rating: 7/10-Not great, but not terrible.

Although it had a charging cable, the length is very short. The sound quality is okay. The box included additional tip sizes for your ears. They are comfortable. These Beats Studio Buds were available at another retailer, but not in this red color. I was excited to be able to purchase this red for the same price here at Amazon. Sometimes my little fingers have difficulty pulling the ear bud out of its case, but that may be because of these arthritic fingers. I also question if the battery life is as long as stated. I love the fact that I can connect to music with the press of a button. However, that same button is so sensitive that sometimes I end up disconnecting a caller. The small size of the case allows it to fit inside my jacket pocket, purse pocket, and pencil pouch.

Called the support line, which was Apple support, and nice gentleman walked me through three attempts to re-set, then assured me that since it was under warranty that the problem would be taken care of. I was sent a pre-paid Fed Ex box with instructions to return. Three days later I received the renewed ear buds, which are now working just fine.I would recommend purchasing used ear buds at the reduced price since Apple will honor warranty and repair or replace, which Amazon will not do, but will only refund purchase price.","Reviewed in the United States July 31, 2024",AE6RUVMPIW6ABPCRMHW6R5P2EUMQ,1,0,Color: RedStyle: Studio BudsSet: Without AppleCare+,Beats Studio Buds,0.1647077922077922,0.509025974025974,Neutral

I took them to Apple and got them repaired at no cost.

RZSTHLOHCJIJV,B096SV8SJG,4.0 out of 5 stars Audio quality if quite good and ANC works well but transparency leaves a lot to be desired.,bigyuki555,4,"Audio quality if quite good and ANC works well but transparency leaves a lot to be desired.I switched from AirPod Pro1 after nearly 5 years of daily use believing that the Beats are new and normally only about $75 less than the AirPod Pro so the quality should be pretty similar between 5-year-old AirPods and brand-new Beats, and according to the text descriptions they are...but there is a remarkable difference in performance on the transparency mode.To the point where just having the earbuds in your ears and nothing playing is not any better than just having old style earbuds/earplugs in your ears. Transparency mode is supposed to make it easier to recognize sounds and voices so that you know when to unplug and listen, but it rarely works out that way with these.Score down on the battery life for the fact that the Transparency mode uses more battery but doesn't work well.That said the ANC works well and the audio quality for music (including Dolby Atmos), phone calls, and spoken word/podcast is superb. If you are most interested in audio quality and noise cancellation, then the Beats will tick your boxes.","Reviewed in the United States June 25, 2024",AHPF7TUW7QLABIRVWV55ORHEXFXA,1,1,Color: Moon GrayStyle: Studio BudsSet: Without AppleCare+,Beats Studio Buds,0.2802436125965538,0.532947118241236,Positive
R31F3JV1FZHHWR,B096SV8SJG,5.0 out of 5 stars Prefect,Casey Alcorn,5,"I recently purchased the Beats Studio Buds, and I am thoroughly impressed with their performance and features. These true wireless earbuds offer a fantastic combination of quality sound, active noise cancellation, and versatility across both Apple and Android devices.Firstly, the sound quality is outstanding. The Studio Buds deliver rich, balanced audio with deep bass and clear highs, making them perfect for music, podcasts, and calls. The active noise cancellation feature effectively reduces ambient noise, allowing for an immersive listening experience wherever you are.The earbuds are lightweight and comfortable, designed for extended wear. They come with multiple ear tip options to ensure a secure fit, enhancing noise isolation and comfort even during vigorous activities.I appreciate the IPX4 rating, which makes the earbuds sweat and water-resistant. This feature is ideal for workouts or outdoor use, providing peace of mind against moisture damage.The built-in microphone offers clear voice quality during calls, ensuring excellent communication without background noise interference.Bluetooth connectivity is seamless, thanks to the Class 1 technology, providing a stable connection and extended range for reliable performance.Overall, the Beats Studio Buds are a top-notch choice for anyone seeking high-quality true wireless earbuds with noise cancellation, sweat resistance, and broad compatibility. They combine superior sound with comfort and durability, making them a valuable investment for both music enthusiasts and professionals alike.","Reviewed in the United States June 29, 2024",AHM7ESHVZOTYFVQJFKL6LYJSCKKA,1,5,Color: BlackStyle: Studio BudsSet: Without AppleCare+,Beats Studio Buds,0.3606944444444444,0.5751388888888889,Positive

When I first got them they would last all day without needing a charge but now I can barely get to lunch before needing to charge. That’s the only disappointing part is that battery life doesn’t last long over time of ownership. Great for listening to music all day long. I can’t hear when people come up to my desk.

With the noise cancellation off (i.e., transparency) you can hear outside sounds clearer (not as clear as without the ear buds though).> There are options in the bluetooth settings page (iOS) where the ""press & hold"" function of the ear buds stem can be toggled between ""noise control / Siri"" and turn on ""volume control"".> Battery life is very impressive. For my use case to listen to podcast and music, it lasts for several hours (atleast so far).> When the buds are put in the case, it magnetically latches in the right position.> It fits perfectly in the ear. It has the soft eartips that works better than an airpod pro for me.> It has the ""Find My"" option to locate if misplaced.Just a couple of features that i wish were better if addressed:> Auto audio turn off when the buds are taken off of the ear / falls off the ear. The audio continues in these cases. I.e., if you're listening to a podcast, wants to take it off for a few min and keeps it in your pocket, it can very well turn on accidentally (because it needs only a soft click to turn on) and the podcast would be over by the time you put it back on 😆.> No auto-pairing which is a bit annoying. It automatically connects to the last device it was connected. Each time you need to switch to a new device, the connection has to be established manually.> The three clicks for rewind does not usually take in properly, unless you manage to do the three clicks quite fast. If there is a millisecond delay between the presses, it considers it as a single click which is a command to stop.> If you're connecting to the laptop (Mac), the option to use ""noise control / siri"" Vs ""volume control"" seems to be either-or i.e., you may not have both at the same time.","Reviewed in the United States December 27, 2023",AHWVZ7UB4TNBZUSSELY6RB7RRCUA,1,20,Color: BlackStyle: Studio BudsSet: Without AppleCare+,Beats Studio Buds,0.20966141001855287,0.4455266955266955,Positive
R7PJZSG0CG4IT,B096SV8SJG,5.0 out of 5 stars Happy with these once I got a newer iPhone,Kindle Customer,5,"If I had paid full price for these I would have been more disappointed than I am. The sound quality is very good. I have an iPhone which is supposed to be ideal to use with these Beats but I have ongoing connectivity issues. I have some really cheap ear buds that as soon as I pick up the ear bud, it connects to my phone. These take longer and sometimes simply don’t connect at all. Then I have to put them back in their case and try again. I’m not sure if it is because my iPhone is an older model, but that shouldn’t matter as far as I know. For an Apple product, their quality falls short. I wouldn’t recommend these. I have had better experiences with Taotronics brand. These Beats were on sale and I thought I’d treat myself to something more upscale. I won’t do that again.UPDATE: I recently got a newer iPhone and wanted to edit my original review. Since I got the newer phone, I have had NO issues with the earbuds connecting to my phone. They connect seamlessly just as I hoped they would.","Reviewed in the United States June 2, 2024",AFWQT73EO2KJQIYM7TLI7VWQXCSA,1,0,Color: Sunset PinkStyle: Studio BudsSet: Without AppleCare+,Beats Studio Buds,0.2334259259259259,0.53663139329806,Positive

With my bose in ear headphones they had bass and almost enough volume. I went with these because my bose did not have the battery longevity that I needed. Also the beats don't feel secure in the ear. The bose are heavier but are definitely secure. The audio quality isn't as good as the bose as I felt immersed in the sound like it was coming from all around. I would not buy again nor recommend these for anyone who is an audio enthusiast. I even watched a few reviews and read a few articles about these that stated they were pretty good. Maybe something changed from the time those were written or recorded to this set. Here is what I want, an adjustable set of headphones that don't dial the volume down, have adjustable settings for each frequency range (user set), killer bass, killer highs and mids, last for 4 hours at full volume and don't cost 800 bucks.

RNDGVPHO1V4I5,B096SV8SJG,4.0 out of 5 stars Beats Studio Buds - A Symphony of Style and Sound,dwayne taylor,4,"I recently purchased the Beats Studio Buds - True Wireless Noise Cancelling Earbuds, and after spending some quality time with them, I am thoroughly impressed. These earbuds are a fantastic blend of style, functionality, and sound quality, making them a strong contender in the crowded market of wireless earbuds.Design and Comfort:The first thing that struck me about the Beats Studio Buds was their sleek and minimalist design. Available in a range of colors, they have a modern look that stands out without being too flashy. The earbuds are incredibly lightweight and come with three sizes of ear tips, ensuring a comfortable and secure fit. I wore them for hours without any discomfort, which is a big plus for anyone who uses earbuds extensively throughout the day.Sound Quality:Beats has always been known for its emphasis on bass, and the Studio Buds do not disappoint in this regard. The sound is rich and immersive, with a well-balanced profile that doesn't overly skew towards bass. The mids and highs are crisp and clear, making these earbuds suitable for a wide range of music genres. Whether I was listening to classical, rock, or hip-hop, the audio quality remained consistently impressive.Noise Cancellation and Transparency Mode:The active noise cancellation (ANC) on the Beats Studio Buds is a standout feature. It effectively blocks out ambient noise, allowing for an immersive listening experience even in noisy environments. The transparency mode is equally impressive, letting in just enough sound to keep you aware of your surroundings without diluting the audio quality of what you're listening to.Battery Life and Connectivity:The battery life of the Beats Studio Buds is solid, offering about 8 hours of listening time and more with the charging case. The earbuds also support fast charging, which is a lifesaver when you need a quick boost. Connectivity-wise, they pair seamlessly with both iOS and Android devices, and the connection remains stable even at a distance.Controls and Functionality:The touch controls are intuitive and responsive, allowing for easy management of playback, calls, and ANC modes. I found the controls to be quite user-friendly, with minimal accidental touches.Conclusion:Overall, the Beats Studio Buds - True Wireless Noise Cancelling Earbuds are an excellent choice for anyone looking for high-quality sound, effective noise cancellation, and stylish design in their earbuds. They strike a perfect balance between performance and aesthetics, making them suitable for both casual listeners and audiophiles alike. While they may be a bit pricey, the quality you get justifies the investment. Highly recommended for anyone in the market for a premium wireless earbud experience.","Reviewed in the United States December 27, 2023",AGIAJSPIKY6ECFRXNA6BPVLSNG3A,1,11,Color: RedStyle: Studio BudsSet: Without AppleCare+,Beats Studio Buds,0.29586805555555556,0.5570833333333334,Positive
RGTK8PYYGJ2FG,B096SV8SJG,5.0 out of 5 stars The Best Bass I've Heard from Earbuds,Matthew hoffacker,5,"These earbuds pack an incredible punch, I rated the noise canceling a 4 because i notice a slight decrease in audio quality whilst on since the drivers are dedicating some of their power to canceling out whatever noise is playing.The Unboxing Experience: Apple does Apple really well. All of their products have an amazing unboxing experience curated for them. These lil guys are no exception, I even noticed the piece the earphones are attached to is like a inch thick piece of cardboard that feels more akin to metal than cardboard.THEY HAVE BUTTONS: Yes all of the major earbuds have controls on the units themselves but none that I've used have implemented buttons so well. These buds have a physical clicky button on each earbud that clicks with just enough pressure to negate accidental touches but not so much pressure that your shoving an earbud driver down your ear canal. Another instance of these buds implementing what others have better.From an Android user: These pair exactly like any galaxy buds would and or apple products to an iphone. You open the case and if you have bluetooth on it has a cool little animation of your product on the phone and its a one click pairing system. Incredibly easy.Connecting to a laptop: Your case must have a charge or be plugged in for these to pair to a laptop. Theres a button in between the buds that if held for 3 seconds sends the buds into a pairing mode where they function much like any other bluetooth product on the market.BASS: YES IT DOES.Price: I got these whilst they were on lightning deal for 79.99 and at that price they are unbeatable. I've come from multiple pairs of bluetooth earbud solutions such as Quiet comfort buds from bose, samsung galaxy buds orginial and pro and pro 2, and Ive even tried both airpod pros and standard airpods. With having tried all of these I see benefits to having one pair over the other but with that price being a major standout reason these buds are now my favorite option for wireless earbuds.OVERALL: These things are freaking sweet and if you can find them on sale you should most definitely be considering them as your next daily driver. Battery, Bass, android compatability, style points for someone who grew up in the early 2000s (used to love those big over ears hanging around my neck i thought i was so cool) and although i didn't focus much on their noise canceling in my review they do that well enough to switch on as needed. If you're trying to enjoy the sound quality of a song as much as possible i would just suggest getting ear tips that fit well and seal. Even with NC turned off these things seal so well I can barely hear my own thoughts - rather just bass rattling - just the way i like it.9.5/10 Really not much you could do better with them.","Reviewed in the United States December 31, 2023",AE6EQLGONN4MPXYFETOA3GDK7WBA,1,40,Color: BlackStyle: Studio BudsSet: Without AppleCare+,Beats Studio Buds,0.16554951690821254,0.43384230503795723,Neutral

R2J7QWXMNJ99A7,B096SV8SJG,"3.0 out of 5 stars Slippery design, battery and other issues!",Amazon Customer,3,"These Beats earbuds offer decent sound quality, but audiophiles should temper their expectations. While aesthetically appealing, the slippery plastic on both the earbuds and the charging case creates significant usability issues. Removing the earbuds is a slippery frustrating task, and their slick surface makes it difficult to precisely position them for charging. The magnetic charging wells are helpful, but the earbuds often slip and slide between fingers before finding their proper place. A more textured, grippy material would have been a welcome improvement. A slight irritating ticking noise occurs when the earbuds are idle, though thankfully masked by music. Battery life is a major disappointment, falling far short of advertised claims with a mere 3-3.5 hours of use before reaching a critical 15% charge. The noise cancellation is barely noticeable, with only a very subtle audio cue to indicate its activation, which can almost be missed. Additionally, the physical button on the earbuds feels prone to wear and tear and its audible click is distracting and uncomfortable in the ear canal. Overall, I'm underwhelmed by these earbuds and question whether I received a defective pair.","Reviewed in the United States August 1, 2024",AGNI36H7MMREKIH6HPQHV2CGG7BA,1,0,Color: BlackStyle: Studio BudsSet: Without AppleCare+,Beats Studio Buds,-0.015833333333333338,0.5750476190476191,Neutral

R1JHXUI1QK56NR,B096SV8SJG,3.0 out of 5 stars Does the job,David K.Haley,3,"So far I have to say these just get the job done. Not the best wireless headphones I’ve had but they’re not terrible. I do like the sounds quality and that my music sounds very clear. They are noise canceling and the battery life is also good. I can wear these all day at work with no issues of them dying. Down side to these are the transparency and noise canceling features suck. The features aren’t really necessary since the headphones themselves block out noise very well. You’ll hear just a bunch of interference when either of those modes are on. Connection issues at times. It only happens when I first put the headphones on. They seem to want to disconnect but after a while they continue to play music fine with no issues. Talking on the phone with these has been alright so far but I’ve had a few times where people can’t hear me very well. Overall if you’re looking for headphones that play music well, last long, and block out most noise then these will do.","Reviewed in the United States August 1, 2024",AHP77IT3ZXBT2AUVKCV2J3AKQTZQ,1,0,Color: BlackStyle: Studio BudsSet: Without AppleCare+,Beats Studio Buds,0.20506172839506176,0.5104012345679012,Positive

R12JTQNZSU744L,B096SV8SJG,4.0 out of 5 stars Execellent for Audiobooks,Jillalex,4,"I am glad I bought these, especially when they were on sale for ~$75. I was struggling with wired earbuds and a new iPhone 15, which meant having to use an adapter, and I was frustrated by the ones I tried. I thought I would lose mobile earbuds but it's been a month, so far so good.For my primary use, listening to audiobooks, these work great. The sound quality is fine. I've listened to music—also fine.It comes with a few alternate earbud sizes, but none has been a perfect fit. One side or the other falls out when I lean over, so I have to make sure they're in good. When one falls out, I don't know why, but it's almost impossible to find, even though they're red. I've used FindMy a few times. I have to move the base and the other earbud into another room as far away as possible, and under a pillow, or I can't differentiate the FindMy beeps. But FindMy works great!Last week, while washing dishes, my left earbud popped out—into a bowl of water! I scooped it out immediately, dried it off, and planned to put it in a baggy with silica packets. I was sure I'd killed it. But I am not very patient. I popped it back in after a minute. It worked great!!They have an okay run time but I am often surprised when I hear the signal that means the battery is almost out. On the plus side, when I pop them back in the case for even 15 minutes, they charge fast. At night, I charge the case and within maybe 15–30 minutes, it's all charged up, so I can then charge my phone.I'm not sure that the background cancelling works well or that there's much if any difference, according to people I've been on the phone with. Since I know that, I wait to do the dishes when I'm off the phone. Kind of a drag.","Reviewed in the United States January 24, 2024",AH3UG5KR6JLVKMYMZSEU2DPIDMTQ,1,7,Color: RedStyle: Studio BudsSet: Without AppleCare+,Beats Studio Buds,0.105036855036855,0.5268120393120393,Neutral

R2ZTC75NUZSKYY,B096SV8SJG,4.0 out of 5 stars Decent for the price when on sale,Amazon Customer,4,"Well let’s start off with I bought these on sale for around $80.If I would’ve paid the full amount of 150 I’m not going to lie and say I wouldn’t have been disappointed.Apple bought out beats audio a few years back so I expected more. The quality is alright but could be better. My biggest disappointment was how they aren’t too compatible with Siri. I’m a delivery driver so I can’t always pull out my phone to unlock it and reply to texts. I came from air pods and air pods will read you texts as they come and let you reply WITHOUT unlocking your phone. These beats DO NOT do that, they won’t read texts and if you ask if you have new messages it will require you to unlock your phone. Also the Siri voice sounds a little muffled and it doesn’t always pick up what you say when you do use voice to text. That’s the most disappointing thing about these, I thought since they were bought out by Apple years ago they would imply the same software but no.Overall they’re decent, nothing to out of the ordinary.The noise canceling is nice. They also come with different sized rubber attachments so you can swap them out if they don’t fit right.Another thing I might add is that they’re a little bulky. The first few days of using them my ears would be sore just from wearing them. Again on sale they’re worth it ($80) but at full price ($150) I would’ve been much more disappointed.Overall the sound quality is crisp but I personally feel like it could use a little more bass, these tend to be louder with the quality of voice over the quality of the music.That being said the battery life is okay, it’s nice that the case charges them. There’s also no way to see the battery levels of the case unless you have an iPhone and open the case near it. On the case itself it only has a small light that turns red when low.","Reviewed in the United States December 25, 2023",AFFMX6QW56DDKHV6PJ4JGPCEPVNA,1,21,Color: RedStyle: Studio BudsSet: Without AppleCare+,Beats Studio Buds,0.12541973791973793,0.4566543816543817,Neutral

Another positive is the controls on the earbuds work relatively well compared to many others. The problem comes in the fact that the sound will pop in and out intermittently while you are exercising or walking. The biggest problem I had and the reason for the low rating is that they will come unpaired sometimes if you pull an earbud out of your ear and they will not re-pair on your phone by turning Bluetooth on or off or anything else. The only way to get them to re-pair is to put them back in their charge box and pull them back out again. That doesn’t do any good when their charging box is hours away and you’re out exercising. The last time that happened to me, I took the earbuds out and threw them in the woods as far as I could throw them. I have a couple sets of wireless earbuds that don’t sound as well, but I would much rather have them as they are reliable.

RUUJJA0TERA67,B096SV8SJG,5.0 out of 5 stars Compared to 4 other Earbuds...,Connor,5,"I bought these earbuds along with 4 other pairs, with the intent of comparing them over a couple weeks and returning all but my favorite. Here were the results:Beats Fit Pro - https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09JL65GNM?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_detailsPros – These buds had some great base, and the wingtip gave them a fit that made them refuse to fall out of my ears. But the best feature? Physical “clicky” buttons on each one of the buds. You press in and hear/feel the click, rather than relying on a touchscreen-like feature. No need to guess if you tapped them once or twice, you will know.Cons – The wingtip gives a very sturdy fit, but not the most comfortable. I wouldn’t recommend to anyone with smaller ears. The noise canceling was solid, but nothing special. And this may be picky, but I didn’t care for most of the color schemes available. I prefer my earbuds to be hard to notice, and even the black ones have a bright red letter “b” in the middle.Beats Studio Buds - https://www.amazon.com/dp/B096SV8SJG?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_detailsPros – Very comfortable with the same great physically “clicky” buttons as the Beats Fit Pro. Noise canceling seemed slightly better than average. Great base. Classic look.Cons – Tested during a workout, a little bit of sweat had these sliding right out of my ear. The case for these earbuds also was the flimsiest of any I had tested, with a very weak hinge that I was scared of breaking off within the 2 weeks of using.Samsung Galaxy Buds Pro - https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08MWZHHKP?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_detailsPros – A neat feature that I noticed only in these earbuds was that it had noise amplification as well as noise cancelation. With one swipe in the app, the surrounding sound was actually louder and clearer than it would be without the earbuds in. Great if you are hard of hearing, or just enjoy snooping on conversations out of reach.Cons – Similar to the Beats Studio Buds, these didn’t stay in during a workout. They were usable, but every 10 minutes I found myself pushing them back into my ear. And this is an opinion, but these are the ugliest earbuds out of the bunch. The shiny black gleam made it look like a large beetle was hanging out in my ear. No visible brand placement either, which makes them appear cheap and generic rather than the quality Samsung they are.Samsung Galaxy Buds Live - https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09TBM1L3S?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_detailsPros – Cost effective! I added these to the test group because of the unique shape, and for that they are worth giving a try. If you have small ears and do not like the rubber insert that is standard in most other earbuds, these may be perfect for you.Cons – Poor fit for large ears. These were tested the least of all of the buds, because the fit was so bad for my ear shape that they wouldn’t stay in if I turned my head too fast.Bose QuietComfort - https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08C4KWM9T?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_detailsPros – Bose noise canceling is unmatched. If your primary use for earbuds is to cancel out that background white noise, this is the pair for you. The sound quality is great, not too heavy on the base. The case for the earbuds stood out from the rest as the only one that impressed me. Felt very study, and I had no worries tossing it into a gym bag or cup holder. The only case with a button latch to make sure it doesn’t open accidentally.Cons – This was the most expensive pair of earbuds by a longshot, and there were still some things I felt could be improved. The rubber inserts had more of a “flayed” shape rather than the “rounded” shape that is standard. My guess is that this was by design, because the earbuds were also slightly heavier than others and may need that extra in-ear grip. The flayed shape did make them sturdier, but at the cost of them being uncomfortable in an active situation. They were also the largest earbuds, and stuck out from the side of my head further than I would have liked.My favorite? The beats fit pro! While I wouldn’t recommend this pair for everyone, it was perfect for my routine. My music taste benefits from the boosted base, and the wingtip shape was perfect for any workouts. The feature that really convinced me was the physical buttons, something that I didn’t realize how desperately I needed.","Reviewed in the United States August 11, 2022",AFEITP6Y25NKH3KB2LXWQCC7STIA,1,2284,Color: BlackStyle: Studio BudsSet: Without AppleCare+,Beats Studio Buds,0.16530880230880232,0.5307694003527337,Neutral
R3EO2GBST2UICI,B096SV8SJG,5.0 out of 5 stars Initial review and comparison to other brands,philip seitz,5,"I love these earbuds. They feel definitely worth the price and a all around great buy. Giving me exactly what I was looking for.For years I have used the raycon E55 and some of the features I loved about raycon was the manual button in the earbuds, excessive bass and great inside-ear fit.Recently however, raycon has gone the way of the world— they have put sensors on the earbuds in the place of buttons and Balanced out the audio. So I began my search for new earbuds.—THE SOUND—Both the AirPods, galaxybuds and raycons I have tried tend to be balanced and prioritize giving equal notes to all instruments For a clear and concise sound, But to someone who is not an audiophile it sounds very flat and devoid of the punch that I desire. For me- I want it to be great sounding but also noticeably bass heavy. These Beats Studio buds deliver. The company recognizes that your not using these to analyze a song. These are for the people who like bass and want to feel some gravitas in their ears!—CONNECTIVITY—These connect effortlessly to iPhone, as if they were AirPods. It was the single biggest factor that blew me away with these. They are incredibly easy to connect. I cannot speak for android but these work great. They do not have a lot of audio adjustments like Bose but I frankly don’t need them to. You can easily see the battery state on both buds and the case from a pop up window in your apple home screen whenever opening the case, just like AirPods.—FIT—The fit is not as good as the raycon E55 but only by a little bit. They fit snuggly in your ears well enough that they do not fall off when running and working out. Although adjustments might need to be made to them occasionally. (I have small ears, so the fit is review as such)—THE CONTROLS—The controls are simple and straightforward. They are just like what you come to expect from earbuds. Single tap, double tap, triple tap.The earbuds HAVE AN ACTUAL BUTTON… which I thought was extinct, I personally hate the sensor buttons because adjusting your earbuds in your ears would trigger the controls.While these do have a very sensitive physical button— it is easy to avoid while adjusting with practice.—BATTERY—The battery lasts me all day, what more do you want?—RANGE—Very good, about 30+ feet—CONS—-no MagSafe compatible charging-fit isn’t as perfect as some brands but is really good-if your an audiophile these earbuds are not balancedFinal call-If you like bass, and hate the sensor controls on most earbuds— these very well could be the best earbuds you could get. These are on par with earbuds in the 200$ range. And if your anything like me, you will love them! And if not, they might still be worth it to you—UPDATE—they have a hard time staying in when working out, and so I had to buy wing tips for these. They automatically have active noise cancellation on when you take them out of the case… which I personally hate.And the cases battery is pretty short lived… only lasts two days generally","Reviewed in the United States September 28, 2023",AFMDCDCHBIWSEI6RDYBCY4MXXVZQ,1,563,Color: BlackStyle: Studio BudsSet: Without AppleCare+,Beats Studio Buds,0.17547510822510823,0.5111769480519481,Neutral

R29LYUZ7DI2CS6,B096SV8SJG,"4.0 out of 5 stars Quality sound and build, BUT...",Everest,4,"After using these for a couple weeks straight, I think it's time to review.I would like to state upfront that I bought these on sale for $75. I bought the black ones because the pink ones weren't on sale.Let's start with some pros:The sound is very good, just about on par with my IEMs. These are definitely catered towards more bassy genres, but in the case of metal, I like being able to hear bass along side lead, and provides some heavy kicks. The physical button instead of just touch is an odd choice, but it works. The package comes with a free trial of Apple music (which I will never use), as well as a tiny usb-c to usb-c charger (so hopefully you have a spare usb-c block), and 3 different sized tips, small, meduim, and large. These have awareness mode, as well as a noise isolation mode. Awareness mode is nice, but noise isolation causes me to have a headache.Now some cons:This may be just my ears, but the small tip is too small, and the medium is just big enough to still be pushed out. The body is very smooth, and if you're someone that produces a lot of earwax (like me), it won't stay put and the only thing keeping it in is the tips, meaning you have to keep pushing them back in, and bumping the button. These sit in a very specific position, but don't really like to stay there. Because of the sound mostly being catered towards bass, some leads and vocals can sound a bit muddy at times. By default, the case doesn't have a loop for a string to hold on to and the case is very smooth, so you have to buy a third party case and put it over the stock case just to make it easier to hold on to. These come with an app, and it's very lackluster. No equalizer, there's a find earbuds feature but I'm pretty sure it's not GPS, and you can't mess with settings if the earbuds aren't connected, not to mention: why do my earbuds need to update?!In conclusion: these are good earbuds and I recommend them, but ONLY IF THEY'RE ON SALE.These are 100% worth the $75 I spent on them, but NO WAY ARE THEY WORTH THE $150 RETAIL PRICE TAG.","Reviewed in the United States August 3, 2024",AEDBORE5CT34E6D7QVXFZW5ZERCA,1,5,Color: BlackStyle: Studio BudsSet: Without AppleCare+,Beats Studio Buds,0.15609410430839002,0.45681311413454295,Neutral

R3OTWPP01KM2BY,B096SV8SJG,3.0 out of 5 stars actually disappointing,kimmy,3,"bought these after my airpod pros died on me suddenly. i have been using these beats studio buds for about 6 months and the experience has been inconsistent to say the least. first issue: they fall out of my ears if i do simple things like turn my head or chew. i can barely walk or exercise with them in because they just fall out. i looked online and it seems others have had these issues; people were suggesting swapping the size of the actual ear bud and even wearing them in reverse (with the left bud in the right ear and right bud in left ear). neither if these worked for me. really made me appreciate the airpod design.it was fairly easy to connect the very first time but every time after that is almost always a pain. if the case is dead but the beats themselves are still charged it’s like it doesn't recognize that the beats are still working and refuses to connect. even if the case is charged sometimes it just will not recognize that the beats are in range of my phone, even if they're sitting right on top of each other. if it’s not straight up refusing to connect it’s disconnecting randomly. if i open my car door - even with the car turned off - the beats automatically disconnect from my phone as if it expects me to connect my phone to carplay. there are many times i have been talking on the phone using my beats and suddenly they will disconnect.the controls only kind of work. you can use the default preset controls like pressing twice for skipping songs and once for hanging up calls and the like. however you're supposed to be able to customize these controls to in your phone settings but they only work as long as the beats are disconnected. as soon as you put the beats away and disconnect everything goes back to default settings the next time you reconnect. noise cancellation is a joke, it sounds the same as when its on transparent mode or off.the case feels like cheap plastic. i got a silicone case because i was afraid of scratching it up. not much else to say about it.the color of the beats are great. i got red and it looks super cool. i think the sound quality is on par with my old airpod pros. when i am on the phone others have not had a problem with not hearing me or me coming across muffled, so that’s a plus.overall, these earbuds are nothing special. i got these around the holidays when they were almost half off. glad i didn’t pay full price for these as they are disappointing at best.ETA: as of july 2024 i ditched these and bought another pair of airpod pros. literally no regrets.","Reviewed in the United States May 25, 2024",AFSUYJ3N2JAFCBPFF7G6VM5LLT5A,1,70,Color: RedStyle: Studio BudsSet: Without AppleCare+,Beats Studio Buds,0.12759740259740257,0.448728354978355,Neutral

The sound quality is fantastic, delivering crisp highs and deep, rich bass that makes every song sound amazing. They’re incredibly comfortable to wear, and once I got the ear placement right (thanks to a quick YouTube video), they fit perfectly and stayed put even during workouts.

Since there are colors that you can choose from and the performance is really good especially for 150 or 100 on sales it has paid off going on trips now you don’t have to listen to a little kid crying on a plane with noise cancellation for all that I can tell.

I replaced it with Beats, as they were on sale, and I wanted to give them a try. The case is slightly larger. The bud shape is different than the airpods so it takes getting use to, to place them in your ear or case. The rubber does a better job sealing so the base sounds stronger. The buttons have a haptic click, so you know when you have activated the switch. Care is required when positioning, or snugging them in your ear so that the switch is not accidentally pushed.","Reviewed in the United States August 6, 2024",AFSVMO74ABFRASWH3LWNQ4OUM5FA,1,0,Color: BlackStyle: Studio BudsSet: Without AppleCare+,Beats Studio Buds,-0.1794871794871795,0.5893162393162393,Neutral

The bose are heavier but are definitely secure. The audio quality isn't as good as the bose as I felt immersed in the sound like it was coming from all around. I would not buy again nor recommend these for anyone who is an audio enthusiast. I even watched a few reviews and read a few articles about these that stated they were pretty good. Maybe something changed from the time those were written or recorded to this set. Here is what I want, an adjustable set of headphones that don't dial the volume down, have adjustable settings for each frequency range (user set), killer bass, killer highs and mids, last for 4 hours at full volume and don't cost 800 bucks.

R2OL6WGA32OZ1,B0D3JB14QS,3.0 out of 5 stars Middle-of-the-road earbuds in a small case,Dave Gilbert,3,"I had high hopes for these given the brand reputation - Beats are a well-established partner for Apple and are supposed to be good for listening to music. Beats are known to be particularly good for bass-heavy music; I have a pair of Beats over ear headphones and they are decent. These earbuds however do not live up to the reputation.Pros:* I was excited to see how small the case is for these earphones. It is significantly smaller and lighter than the typical Apple airpods case, for example. I ordered in the translucent red and it is a cool look. I like being able to see the electronics within the case (the buds are solid color red).* the form factor and related design of the buds is excellent. They are covered in a rubberized material typical for sports electronics, making them water and sweat resistant as well as mostly impervious to dirt. the fit in the ear is really good, and they come with multiple sets of ear tips in matching color. They do not fall out of my ear despite use during sports / exercise.* sound quality for phone use is very good. I can hear well and callers can hear me. They hold up to reasonable background noise.* sound quality for podcasts and other spoken word is also good. I can hear clearly and volume is sufficient.* iphone integration is decent. The earbud controls appear on iphone in a similar fashion to airpods.* battery life is good. I would estimate 10-12 hrs on a single charge.* they come with a 1-year warrranty from Apple (as documented in the product guide)Cons:*sound quality with music is only so-so. I was frankly disapointed. They do not hold up well in an A-B comparison with my Apple Airpod Pros (2nd generation) - a decent Mid-Fi option. In my opinion these are unsuitable for listening to music.* no case battery. The reason the case is so much smaller is because the case itself cannot charge the ear buds without being plugged in. I guess this is ok since the battery life on the ear buds is very good compared with others, but it was a surprise to me.* missing my favorite airpod feature - automatic pause. On my airpods, if I take one out of my ear the source pauses. Seems like a missed opportunity given the existing integration.","Reviewed in the United States July 2, 2024",AFQNCPIKKEK67YQSJQXF2UKQML4A,0,0,Color: Transparent RedStyle: Solo Buds,Beats Solo Buds,0.253926406926407,0.4936904761904762,Positive
R1LERTLVVTROBV,B0D3JB14QS,4.0 out of 5 stars Beats Solo Buds: Compact Sound Titans in a Budget-Friendly Package,JAYSIN,4,"The Beats Solo Buds are a testament to the brand's **continued attention to sound quality**, delivering an auditory experience that impresses at its price point. While they may lack a battery within the case, reducing the overall listening time, the buds themselves offer an **excellent battery life**. In testing, they lasted just shy of **17.5 hours**, though individual results may vary slightly. Their portability is a significant advantage, making them a convenient choice for on-the-go music enthusiasts.It's true, the absence of an **IP rating** for water and sweat resistance, along with the lack of noise canceling or spatial audio features, might be seen as downsides. However, these omissions are somewhat mitigated by the buds' affordability. The removal of the indicator light, a seemingly small feature we've all come to rely on, is a curious choice by Apple. It's akin to a phone without a camera; it functions, but something feels amiss. Now, users must rely on their phones to check the battery life and confirm if the charging cable is properly connected. For iPhone users, this information is conveniently displayed via an on-screen card, while Android users can find it in the app.Despite these quirks, the Beats Solo Buds strike a balance between **size, sound quality, and price** that many will find just right. For those seeking alternatives, the Soundcore Space A40 offers a similar size, more overall battery life, a wireless charging case, and comparable sound quality with a bit more sub-bass impact. They also boast a comfortable fit with ANC and an actual **IPX4 rating**, all at a price point that's often under $50 on sale, available in black, blue, and white—all of which are quite stylish. Ultimately, the Beats Solo Buds stand out for their portability and sound quality, making them a worthy consideration for those prioritizing these features within this price range.","Reviewed in the United States June 22, 2024",AER7PTMSQZFO5CNGSYDORW6DEDGQ,0,6,Color: Transparent RedStyle: Solo Buds,Beats Solo Buds,0.20150669642857144,0.47064732142857146,Positive

These paired easily and quickly with my phone and come with a great slim carry case which also keeps the earbuds charged. They also come with various ear tips so you can customize the fit. They stay in my ears even if I shake my head hard so that's good too. I still prefer earbuds with a silicone piece that locks them into my ears though. Mostly what I don't like about these is the sound quality. There is just something off about the sound. It has this distant quality to it that seems strange.

R3KI9GNXUTY8X4,B0D3JB14QS,3.0 out of 5 stars Doesn't live up to the brand name,Cheesy,3,"TL;DR - Great fit and comfort, pretty, average sound quality. Expensive.Beats has really made a name for itself as a brand and is considered a higher end option for sound. When I received this pair of earbuds, my impression was that it sounds the same as my skullcandy buds... For a brand that advertises itself as being a first choice for music buffs who are invested in quality sound, I couldn't tell much of a difference. There is no EQ setting to tinker with in an app like I've seen in some other earbuds that market themselves as musically superior. In fact, the Beats app seems to only exist to show you adds for more Beats.But, I am not picky about my earbuds. I usually pick based on pricing, comfort, and convenience over sound quality. That being said, these buds fit in the ear much easier AND more comfortably than the skullcandy ones I've used in the past. They are extremely comfortable and do not fall out. The case (transparent red) is very attractive and slim and the lid doesn't fly open accidentally to make you risk losing a bud.Ultimately, they are better than previous earbuds I've used, but only in comfort and fit, not in sound. I don't know if I'd shell out an extra $40 for these just for a more comfortable fit vs. the $39.99 competitor.TL;DR - Great fit and comfort, pretty, average sound quality.

If that is your expectation too, then get ready to be disappointed as I was. The sound on these is not great and really falls flat. The range is just poor, and I can't find any way to adjust it in the app.At $80 I guess I can't complain about it too much, but I thought I was sacrificing things like a battery in the case not actual sound performance.The fit is ok, but multiple times they have fallen out while using on the elliptical and the controls are hard to use because they are physical buttons that force movement of the bud when pressing. On the plus side you don't accidentally pause your music when readjusting like the touch sensitive ones do.Personally, I don't see these as being a daily driver. I think I will throw them in my travel bag so if I forget to pack or don't have room for my primaries, I at least have something.Overall, I don't recommend these, there are much better options in this price range, beats really missed the mark on this release!","Reviewed in the United States July 2, 2024",AHY5C3OQ4B5WHDQSIPWGFTRCPV2Q,0,0,Color: Matte BlackStyle: Solo Buds,Beats Solo Buds,0.0746969696969697,0.3931601731601732,Neutral

They represent Beats' approach to minimalist function, design, but kind of miss the mark.These buds are small. You do have several options of sizing for yours ears, but once those things are in, you want to be careful operating the touch controls as each slight tap feels as though you may be pushing them further into your ear canals.Sound wise, I wasn't too impressed. The highs/mids were decent, but the bass seemed lacking a bit compared to other buds that I've used. I can't really say much on the ANC as I didn't really need it. With enough volume, everything outside was pretty much muted...typical of this style of earbud.There was an app that requested to download that allowed for manipulation of some features, but having to install an app and give up permissions can often be concerning.For phones conversations, these weren't bad. You could hear someone on them pretty well, though I found myself sometimes asking others to speak up a bit or having to turn up my volume. However, on my end when wearing them, I could hear them fairly well.Overall, I'm giving a 3 star.","Reviewed in the United States July 3, 2024",AF7KO44UUWM5HRSMTFYCUQI56VOA,0,0,Color: Storm GrayStyle: Solo Buds,Beats Solo Buds,0.15520833333333336,0.5499999999999999,Neutral

R3CG9KMYIHUOFI,B0D3JB14QS,1.0 out of 5 stars Mediocre sound; lacking features; works with iPhone,Anne Swan,1,"This is a very disappointing product from Beats. I've had the fantastic Power Beats Pro ear buds with ear hooks and lots of features for a couple years, so I expected more from this product--even at the low price point. First, the positive features: they were easy to pair with my iPhone 15 Pro Max. They also came with some charge; they do hold a charge for a long time and charge up quickly. The built in microphone worked for phone calls. The best feature was that the XS ear tips fit my small ear canal; I've not ever had an ear bud type that actually staying in my ear before--a first! The translucent red case and the red earbuds are attractive. The small case is portable, but frankly, I have no problem taking my slightly larger Power Beats Pro case anywhere I need it.Now, for the other aspects: The ""selling"" feature of this is its small size. Frankly, it makes it harder to maneuver, to get the buds out of the case and into ears. But most importantly, the sound is mediocre or less. There is no noise cancelling, and for some reason I have the volume setting on my iPhone turned as high as it will go and the sound on the earbud is at a low volume. Why won't the volume increase as typical speakers or headphones? Turns out I need some unnamed app to control the volume. But the instructions don't name the app. Also, I was unable to locate the app in the Apple App store. All I could find was an app for Beats Pill.As others have mentioned, the sound is in the high and mid-range--so the base is missing in the rock music and the classical music I prefer. I've had sound this ""good"" from cheap wired pairs. I would have liked some indication of which is right and left. The buds are very small, and I find it tricky to align them in the proper way to get them in the case. There is no noise cancelling feature; other offerings around this price point offer that. Also, this doesn't come with a cable or plug. I happen to have several USB-C cables and plugs, but if you don't have one, there's another expense. AIn my opinion, the positive features don't overcome the poor sound quality and the lack of noise cancelling. These do not make listening fun. I cannot recommend this product.","Reviewed in the United States July 1, 2024",AE2YL4P67J4E3A5T6LTRUHF4VERQ,0,1,Color: Transparent RedStyle: Solo Buds,Beats Solo Buds,0.10194409756909757,0.4385248085248085,Neutral

They also are not that loud and when you consider they don't have NC or a battery in the case it's just an all around bad purchase. These sound like some $30 earbuds that I own. On the pro side they are small and the case is beautiful but not having a battery is kind of weak It honestly seems like Beats has different teams working on their earbuds and headphones. The two recent headphones (solo 4 and studio pro) have been really good and all of their wireless earbuds have been bad.

Just looking at them, I figured the fit would be an issue, but they fit my ears great. The sound of them when working properly was pretty good and they offer pretty impressive bass response for ear buds. This is unfortunately where the positives end.As marks on the negative side, the buttons on the side of the earbuds you can use to perform different functions are terrible. They are hard to find even when you know where they are and you have to press on them way too firmly to get them to work. I don't really want to have to shove the earbud halfway to my brain to depress the button. For the price point, you would expect noise cancellation and ambient mode. Nope, like Charlie Sheen they have one speed. Onto the most damning aspect, the left earbud quit working after only about 10 uses. That's right, 10 uses. I have had ear buds that cost less than half that outlasted these by years.Beats is a name that should be synonymous with quality.

R3ACA4BFELO1SS,B0D3JB14QS,3.0 out of 5 stars Apple/Beats is walking a middle line with these,This Is Not,3,"I've been using these the last couple of days as my everyday drivers. I have tried Beats earbuds before, mainly the Studio Buds and the Studio Buds+. Neither stayed in my ears without relying on foam ear tips. So, I never fully switched to them and returned them for other products. I have a pair of old PowerBeats Pro, but I stopped using them a while back because they don't have ANC and rely on Lightning for charging (which should be a sin in 2024). I've always wanted to like the Studio Buds and Buds+ due to their design and overall solid build, but they never stayed in my ears.The same holds true with the Solo Buds. They're just like the Studio Buds+, just a little smaller and lighter. If the Studio Buds/Buds+ didn't stay in your ears, these ones won't either. I went through all the different ear tip sizes and medium fit me the best, but I had to push the right earbud back into my ear every hour or so.While I had these in my ears, I was able to do some listening. They popped up on my iPhone 15 Pro Max like all other Beats and Apple earbuds/headphones. You get some options in the iOS settings and the drop down menu. Unlike AirPods, these do not feature head tracking for spatial audio (though they do work with spatial audio, so does ANY pair of earbuds or headphones) or any ANC whatsoever. The charging case does not have a battery in it either. These earbuds last for about 17 hours (Apple advertises 18 hours) when I listened to them at about 75% volume.One thing that took me back was just how quiet these were. I had the same issue with the Studio Buds+. I have Soundcheck turned on in Apple Music due to listening to Atmos/Spatial tracks. It turns up their volume to match the volume of other tracks in my library while normalizing track volumes across the board. Still, I have other earbuds and headphones from Sony, Moondrop, and Heavys that don't require my iPhone's volume set to 75% for comfortable listening.Although the battery life is exceptional, charging these is a pain. Like I said, the case doesn't have a battery in it which means you need to be near a power source to recharge these. The case doesn't have a charging indicator light, so you don't know the charging state of the earbuds. Are they full, half, or somewhere between? I don't know, you need to lift their lid to find out. The bottom of the case is flat, just like Sony's case for their WF-1000XM5 earbuds (my everyday pair after I test others). It works for Sony because the case supports Qi charging. The Solo Buds case is begging to have a Qi charger in it. That would have helped immensely with the charging situation. Plop them on a Qi charger with an indicator light and wait for it to turn off. At least then you could tell when the earbuds were fully charged.But nope, Apple cut corners here and the case's only purpose is to take power from the back USB-C port and pipe it to the prongs connecting to the earbuds.Overall, the sound quality is fine, albeit very generic. Bass isn't boosted, neither are trebles. I would say this is a slight V-shaped curve, but not much. People expecting a bass boosted profile should know that these fit in the current Beats sound signature of things being flatter and more accurate. It's a little baffling given the history of Beats and that most people, especially those buying mainstream audio products, like a V-shaped sound signature with boosted lows and highs.I listened to modern pop, some metal, hard rock, and dubstep. It all sounded fine. Details were there, but not as much as my Sony WF-1000XM5. But I expected that given the price difference between these and the Sony earbuds (they MSRP for over 4X as much). There isn't wear detection or anything else fancy. Microphone quality is fine, it works but they do let in more outside noise than I'm used to. There isn't any special microphone noise cancelling like with other earbuds. If there is, I'm not hearing it.The biggest reason why I gave these 3 stars and not more is because, compared to other earbuds, these are far too expensive and should be in the $30 price range. Take the Soundcore A40 earbuds. They MSRP for $80 but are routinely on sale for $60 (sometimes even $50). They have less battery life, ""only"" 10 hours compared to 18. But that 10 hour battery life is while using ANC. It isn't the best ANC, but it's ANC nonetheless and that's something the Solo Buds do not have.The Soundcore A40 also have a companion app letting you adjust the EQ to your liking. It isn't an advanced EQ, but it's better than nothing and I think they sound much better than the Solo Buds. They aren't as quite and my iPhone sits at about 40-50% volume instead of 75% for comfortable listening (not even loud listening). The Soundcore A40 have a case featuring a battery and you can recharge the earbuds 4 more times. Their case also features Qi and USB-C charging with an indicator light. You know the rough battery percentage for the earbuds without popping the lid open. You can place the A40 case on a Qi charger and it will recharge both the case and earbuds without issues.For $20 less (right now), you can get a much better pair of earbuds from Soundcore/Anker that have more features and better sound quality. They don't have a fancy animation when you open them next to your iPhone or Android phone, but you get so much more out of them.Honestly, if Apple put a $30 price sticker on these, I would fully recommend them. You're getting neutral sounding earbuds with some smart features (mainly pairing and automatic spatial audio on iPhones). For $30, it's fine to miss a few features like wear detection and the lack of a battery in the charging case. But, at their current full MSRP (or even down to $50), these just aren't worth it, not for the compromises. If you really need to stick with the Beats brand, I think the Beats Flex are a better buy because they include an Apple chip (better iPhone compatibility) and you can put wing tips on them without ruining their compatibility with a charging case.I've also found the microphone quality to be better with the Beats Flex, it's probably because the microphone is closer to your mouth. I also think the Beats Flex sound better. They're still missing tons of smart features, but they're also often available for $50. They also have a charging indicator light.Honestly, I'm not sure what Apple was thinking with these at their full MSRP. You're paying for a little popup on your iPhone/Android and the Beats name, nothing more. Save money and go with Soundcore/Anker for better earbuds and an overall better package. Either that or, if you really want Beats, get the Beats Flex or wait for these to drop down to $35. They aren't worth more than that.","Reviewed in the United States June 25, 2024",AHIDDYIZWNSZJVM4NNK5Y3ISPKAQ,0,0,Color: Transparent RedStyle: Solo Buds,Beats Solo Buds,0.16074843871975023,0.421796122820713,Neutral
R1KRFPYPQMXVIQ,B0BQPNMXQV,5.0 out of 5 stars Affordable Quality Earbuds,Not what I wished for,5,"Hello! Speaker lover here. I recently bought this a week ago and received them recently. Tested them out.If you bought these because of bass and you love bass, the bass selections that are already on the app don’t work at all and only add just about 5 percent extra bass if you chose one.You’d have to play with the EQ in order to get the bass to work. Since I love speakers a lot and find them fun to use and enjoy the bass part. I’ve messed with the EQ on my phone and got the bass where it’s strong and sounds good but also to where you can still hear it.I also found out that clear to the right on EQ, if you wanted to hear more of the voice, then move the label 4K up higher. It will decrease the bass by a small percentage but still give you that advantage to listen to the bass and still hear the voice louder.Lowering the 4K will add more bass and lower the voice.I’ve provided screenshots of what my configurations are on the EQ and what my general settings are for these earbuds from JBL.My final review is the color is cool, the case is well durable, the earbuds themself are comfortable in your ears, they work well and have a high volume sound. They last a good amount of hours as well which is a big + for me.I did notice someone had posted a review regarding the EQ, I’ve used their EQ style and it flattens the bass and does not give you the bass you want.

R10T5CDIG6Q5UX,B0BQPNMXQV,5.0 out of 5 stars Top quality audio after a few adjustments,P. Dobrinen,5,"This review is about the audio features of the JBL Vibe Beam earbuds.I'm an audio engineer so audio quality is very important to me. As such, I use wired connections as much as possible to maintain the integrity of the audio signal. However, many newer consumer-level products no longer have audio jacks, so I finally decided to invest in some wireless earbuds as a backup to the other earphones and headphones that I use. I didn't want to spend a lot of money as I didn't foresee myself using this product very much, and since this is my first foray into wireless audio earphones, if they were just ok or they broke after a while, then I wouldn't feel too bad about the little money that I spent. Also, I wanted to focus on finding wireless earbuds with excellent audio quality first as I already have an excellent high-end bluetooth earpiece for cell phone use, and I wouldn't be using this product as a bluetooth headset for my phone.After doing much research, I chose the JBL Vibe Beam's as they were at my price point, I'm familiar with JBL products, and I could reasonably expect that they were likely deliver the high audio quality that I've come to expect from JBL products. In my research, I read reviews that complained about the harshness of the high end with high frequency instruments like cymbals or the lack of bass, so I was a bit concerned.When I received and started listening to my JBL Vibe Beams I understood what people were talking about. However, to correct the issues, first, one must have a great fit of the earbuds in their ears. I'm fortunate, in that with the medium tips that were already installed on the Vibe Beams, they made a snug fit in my ears right out of the box. If you find that these earbuds do not fit well in your ears it might be worthwhile to invest in a separate set of variable sized earbud tips, or try tips from one of your other well-fitting earbuds, if you have them. Once the earbuds were seated properly in my ear, that took care of the poor bass issue. (I have not worn them long-term so I can't speak to them falling out of my ear, as others have mentioned, but they seem to stay in pretty well.)For the misaligned frequency response issue, fortunately, the JBL Headphone app that you can install on your cell phone includes a ten-band graphic equalizer that you can use to make adjustments to the frequency response of your earbuds. After listening to several of the reference tracks I use to check new audio equipment or my mixes against, I found that the only adjustments needed were carving out some of the upper midrange and making a very slight boost in the bottom end of the lower frequency spectrum. I've included a screenshot of my EQ curve which I based on the Bass preset in the JBL app. You can't tell as there is no dB scale on the side, but I needed to cut or boost by only 1-2 dB. I find that my new EQ curve gives a more balanced frequency response than what came out of the box, and matches up well against the reference speaker system and headphones that I use for my audio mixing and mastering work. I invite you to use my EQ curve as a starting point and adjust as sounds best to you.I also read reviews complaining about the apparent lack of volume of the Vibe Beams. I connected the JBL's to several different sources (phone, computer, TV, MP3 player, etc.) and I found that the overall maximum volume (with limiter off) is relatively lower than wired speaker versions. However, the input to the JBL's is relative to the maximum output of the source itself. I found that the loudest level I could get came from my iPhone and the lowest level output came from my MP3 player (which probably doesn't offer much output anyway being a tiny portable unit). As a comparison, I did a side-by-side test of the JBL's with my wife's AirPods (2nd gen). What I found was that the JBL's offered an almost identical audio output level as the AirPods with any of the sources I used so that confirmed that the output level of the JBL's has more to do with the source (and the source material as some songs are mastered at a lower volume than other songs) than with the earbuds themselves. During my test, I put the JBL's at their maximum volume output (one tap at a time on the left bud to raise the volume). Also, I noticed during my testing that the AirPods had a pleasing midrange sound perfect for listening to podcasts or watching video, but the JBL's excelled at full-range sound on the bottom and top ends of the frequency spectrum which made them sound much better over all and well-suited for music or listening to explosive action scenes in movies.And speaking of movies, the JBL app has a switchable audio/video mode. The video mode reduces the latency of the delivery of audio against picture, so there isn't a noticeable lip-sync issue with dialogue in a scene. However, there is a slight degradation in the audio quality of 'video' mode versus 'audio' mode, but you will have to make the determination if the change in audio quality is acceptable to you.As a side note, I included a picture of the inner side of the earbuds. The 'L' and 'R' designations on the earbuds are tiny as you can see, plus they are the same color as the earbuds themselves, so they are very hard to see. I wish JBL had made the L/R letters bigger or at least made them a different color so they would be easier to see.The pairing process was fairly easy with all my bluetooth-capable devices and the range was good, only dropping out after walking approximately 60-70 feet from the source. There was one momentary dropout during my listening but that could be due to my wife using her AirPods the same time as I was using the JBL's.I can't speak to the other features of the JBL Vibe Beams as I don't intend to use them, but as far as audio quality goes, with just a few minor tweaks, these bluetooth earbuds can go from sounding like a $50 pair of earbuds to a $500 pair of reference earphones.","Reviewed in the United States October 21, 2023",AHY4E66OMDCFPZWPUF5YLKKGZBHA,1,1022,Color: White,JBL Vibe Beam,0.13638380558835106,0.46709058933490744,Neutral
R2154XSZDSZH0Z,B0BQPNMXQV,"4.0 out of 5 stars Decent ear buds, but fit isn't exact and battery life is questionable",warren smith,4,"I had to replace a set of headphones that stopped working. So this time I thought I would try a set of earbuds instead. I know JBL usually have good products, price was decent, so I thought I would try these.First I will say the sound and volume are pretty good. If you are using these on your phone, the JBL app also makes a big difference with the equalizer and the other ""hear through"" type features if you don't want to block out all noise. Really wish they had a similar app for PC, as I use them on my laptop more than my phone. And is really when I need to hear people talking etc.With that said, the fit isn't great, I tried all the different sizes of the rubber covers, but none seem to fit right in my left ear for some reason. I've had it fall out once already when just bending over to pick something up off the floor.They are also difficult to get out of the case, the lid should open further or just have a way to grab a hold of them easier.The battery life is ok, but doesn't seem to be anywhere near the 32 hours listed, including the recharge feature of the case. I've gotten about half that, before they kept telling me they were ""low battery"". And I had to charge them and the case both back up.all in all, these may work good for some people. I am thinking about returning them and trying something else though.","Reviewed in the United States July 15, 2024",AFN6273O6VY3TZWBMRRXBI5BLU6Q,1,11,Color: Black,JBL Vibe Beam,0.19484126984126982,0.4423721340388007,Neutral

As an avid music lover, I'm always on the lookout for earbuds that deliver exceptional sound quality, and these earbuds absolutely deliver. The JBL Deep Bass Sound technology truly lives up to its name, providing rich, immersive audio that brings my music to life. Whether I'm listening to my favorite tracks or taking calls on the go, the sound clarity and depth are unparalleled.One of the standout features of these earbuds is their Bluetooth 5.2 connectivity, which ensures a seamless and stable connection with my devices. I've never experienced any lag or dropouts, even when moving around in busy urban environments. Plus, the water and dust-resistant design give me peace of mind, knowing that my earbuds are protected against the elements during workouts or outdoor adventures.Comfort is also a priority for me when it comes to earbuds, and the JBL Vibe Beam doesn't disappoint. The ergonomic design and multiple ear tip options ensure a secure and comfortable fit, even during extended listening sessions. And with the hassle-free touch controls, I can easily adjust volume, skip tracks, or answer calls with just a tap.Overall, I couldn't be happier with the JBL Vibe Beam True Wireless Earbuds. They combine top-notch sound quality, reliable connectivity, and comfort in a sleek and durable package. Whether you're a music enthusiast, a fitness fanatic, or simply someone who values convenience and quality in their audio accessories, these earbuds are sure to impress.

The 'JBL Headphones' smartphone app is highly recommended as using the app will allow you to switch to and from audio and video mode. Audio mode has better sound quality and video mode syncs the sound to the video. Honestly, I don't really notice a enough difference in sound quality between the two modes so I tend to keep it in video mode so I can switch between listening to Pandora or watching YouTube without having to open the app and switch modes.The fit is very comfortable and secure in my ears. I haven't used these for working out yet but I feel like I could go jogging or hit the gym and not have to worry about losing them.

I was very impressed they are actually better than my $150 Beats were. Sound is amazing the adjustable equalizer makes getting the perfect sound for your needs easy. They fir in the ear good they ate comfortable and don't fall out like my Beats did. They are a little hard to remove from the case but that's actually a good thing I know ppl complained about that but it also means they are harder to just fall out. Another complaint was about the case being too slippery and getting scratched up easily. My Beats case was more slippery and all cases gets scratches eventually so far I haven't gotten any on these. The battery life is also a huge selling point. I'm not disappointed at all.

R3GKU4H3B5RNTI,B0BQPNMXQV,4.0 out of 5 stars excellent battery life. lots of good feature ideas that don't really work IRL.,Mavev,4,"When i purchased these I didn't know about the touch controls features. so if you touch one of them it will pause what you are listening to or if you touch the other it can adjust the volume depending on where you tap it. it's very sensitive and I find anything that touches it, hair or hat will pause your podcast. You can turn this feature off with the app. The ""find my buds"" feature in the app for this is great in theory, but pretty useless in real life practice. (I lost one of them a week after owning them.) unless they are currently on and bluetooth connected to the phone with the app you can't make it ping the bud and make a sound to find it. so despite knowing where I lost the bud and knowing i was in range I couldn't find it. So i now have one earbud.The sound quality is good but the noise cancelling isn't capable of cancelling out a mower or a weed wacker enough for you to hear what you were listening to clearly. the pass through sound feature isn't really useful either, on this scale the mic quality just isn't good enough to do that and not have people sound like old robots. It does work.. it just makes everything sound like an old mono radio broadcast.The battery life is really the best feature of these buds. I can listen for 5 hours straight and not have to put it back on the charger. I only listen to podcasts on my single remaining ear bud, maybe if you listened to something with more bass it would drain faster. but for my purposes it's perfect. I also really like that the app shows you the remaining battery percentage of each bud","Reviewed in the United States June 3, 2024",AGF33BYGZ466FJY2FSXV2CY77JLA,1,6,Color: Black,JBL Vibe Beam,0.2526958525345622,0.4426651305683563,Positive
R11DL0KDC708HP,B0BQPNMXQV,5.0 out of 5 stars Using these with iphone,Konner Lawson,5,"So I am using these with an iphone 12. There is a slight audio delay between video and audio, and the audio quality is just not that great, but I am assuming that’s apple’s doing for using a non apple product with their phone. I used to use these with a samsung product and they were awesome, liked em a lot. I mostly plan to use these to just listen to stuff, not really watch and listen, so imma keep em because screw apple. If google can make youtube worse on non chrome browsers, im sure apple can affect a device by making the quality a bit worse and purposefully putting in a delay.One month use update: my only real complaint is that they are kind of hard to put away quickly. It takes concentration because you have to rotate them before you put them away, and I have fumbled/dropped them fairly regularly when I am trying to put it away in a hurry or without looking at it. Its hard if you’re trying to put them away with anything else in your hands like a pen, book, bag/purse, sunglasses etc.The charging case could be improved if they made it so that you didn't have rotate them after you took them out of your ears in order to put them away, and if they made the stems completely rounded so that they rotated smoothly.","Reviewed in the United States June 27, 2024",AH3DCSUNI7EEVZQZDKXXSYSKTABQ,1,9,Color: White,JBL Vibe Beam,0.15185185185185188,0.5703228869895536,Neutral

I use the right ear peice only most of the time so I can clearly hear customers and technicians, but still hear and receive messages and calls. I love how clearly I can hear people on phone calls and how well they can hear me. Unless I'm in the back shop with the loud noises from the mechanics (of course). I only get about a half of a work day before I hear the friendly female voice say ""battery low"", and I'm forced to put the right one back in the charging case and switch to the left, which is not preferable as I use my left ear to answer the work phone.My only other negative is that you can't use the find my feature if they're in the case. The other evening as I was emptying my pockets to go to bed I noticed they were missing. It turns out they fell out of my pocket while home TV and it it took me a while to find them. It would've been nice to be able to find them quicker.On the positive side though.I love the ambient aware feature so I really can have conversations without taking them out.They are comfortable and stay in my ears even on my 7 mile bike ride home after work.The sound quality for videos and music are great, no complaints there.When these die or I lose them I'll definitely stay with JBL.

R2BSZ7C5UUTNAA,B0BQPNMXQV,5.0 out of 5 stars Way better than airpods,Emily,5,"I’ve had a couple different generations of AirPods as well as numerous other brands of wireless earbuds (including JBL Tune which I wasn’t a huge fan of). I was looking into getting the AirPods Pro again, but decided I just didn’t want to spend that much money. After some research I ended up choosing JBL Vibe Beam and felt fairly comfortable with my decision because I am a fan of JBL. I do not regret it at all. They are better than AirPods by far - piece of advice get the “JBL Headphones” app. The earbuds automatically come on the Jazz setting so I could see how someone wouldn’t be satisfied. You can change the equalizer (I used one of the top picture reviews and copied how they had theirs, but they also have other presets). I listen to a lot of Rap, Metal Alternative, etc. so bass is a huge thing for me and using the equalizer was a game changer. The sound is so clear and the bass is amazing. This is probably the most satisfied I’ve ever been with an earbud purchase. It’s also super easy to connect them. The name showed up right away so the total process maybe took 10-15 seconds to pair them for the first time, which is pretty rare.

R26HKJ4TFJ7CE,B0BQPNMXQV,"4.0 out of 5 stars Really good sound, but...",Customer,4,"For a $50 pair of ear buds, these sound impressive. I've paid twice the price before and not been nearly this impressed. They bring a new clarity of sound to some albums in which I gave been previously disappointed, eg Clockwork Angels, which has always sounded muddy, even on my custom home sound system. My music tastes have a wide range; whether classical, big band jazz, prog rock, shoe gazer, etc, these buds really deliver for the price. With the app, there is good ability to adjust the sound and other settings, which is very nice, if not unique to JBL.However, there is one big caveat. With all the ear buds I have used over the years, I have never, EVER had such a pain-in-the-*$$ time getting these damn things out of their charging case!! They are stupidly hard to grasp-- they sit deep in the case, don't have a good way to grab them, and the lid very much is in the way of trying to get to them. If you buy these, know you have to be very careful and deliberate about removing them from the case or you will definitely drop them and ultimately ruin them. And if you have big fingers, seriously consider another product...unless you just get a kick out of being extremely frustrated.JBL, if you're listening (sorry for the pun), redesign the case so the ear buds rest in them 180 degrees from the way they do now, increase the surface area to pull them out, and please, PLEASE, redesign the case to have the lid flip farther back out of the way so that people with even average- sized fingers can get to these ear buds!","Reviewed in the United States February 10, 2024",AE6VVSQDU46YIRETGGOOQT3EQPDA,1,7,Color: Black,JBL Vibe Beam,0.11707386363636363,0.529621212121212,Neutral

I agree they sound pretty good for the price. They're not Bose, but we're talking ear buds. The Bose that I listened to were almost130 more and the difference wasn't enough to justify the cost. Just a tip, but if you get a little water on your finger and rub it around ear tip it should solve or at least help the problem with a loose tips.

R3CDU9S5XF66XB,B0C1QWWZR4,3.0 out of 5 stars Low-end Offerings,NORMAN GARCIA,3,"Purchased these JBL Tune Buds a few weeks ago as I had misplaced my Javbra 5 Buds and needed a quick and inexpensive replacement.Here are my observations:Fit - I am of average ear size (I think). I tried all three sizes of bud that came with the packaging. The medium size fit best but by best, I mean just adequate. The silicon buds were cheap feeling and lacked any stiffness that might have helped secure them better to my ear and helped/assisted the ANC when turned on.Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) - I live in a metropolitan area that is chronically loud. If you live in a quieter area, these might work for you. For me, the ANC is poor to adequate and I suspect the ill fitting bud plays into this factor.Software - I feel the software is mediocore at best. I use these buds for playing music and for remote meetings via MS TEAMs. Once the TEAMs meeting starts the software deactivates ANC and you are able to hear the ""ambient' sounds from your surrounding environment. I can hear the meeting participants fine but they complain that they have trouble hearing me. They tell me that the barely hear my voice and instead hear the noise around me. Not sure of the logic making this ""auto ANC off"" for meetings a thing with the buds/software. Ultimately, I just listen and don't offer much feedback because it ends up being a distraction.Talk - On individual calls, friends and family hear me fine.Meetings - not recommended for meetings as the software is set to turn off ANC once a meeting begins.Gaming - I feel that young people could use these phones to game if they are in a quiet setting like their room.Price - I feel that these JBL Tune Buds were priced adequately around $50.Final Thoughts - If you are willing to pay $25 more I recommend Jabra 5 buds.

R1PM8XR6N66HJO,B0C1QWWZR4,5.0 out of 5 stars Mastering Engineer Approved,Jenn,5,"A lot of pros with one con.I didn’t think I had a lot of time for earbuds during the day, so I started off trying a cheap pair. They were $20 or something with 4.8 stars and reviews like, “I haven’t used my Airpods since buying these!” so I thought that sounded perfect.They sucked. The sound was harsh, they became painful after extended use, noise cancelling was barely noticeable, etc. I can’t actually remember all of the problems at this point. BUT they sold me on the functionality of wireless headphones.Fast-forward to a few months later - it’s Black Friday and I bite on these because they’re on sale. I was a little hesitant because they had a lowly 4.2 stars. Turns out average reviews aren’t everything.These are the polar opposite of the highly-reviewed, cheap headphones I tried: they’re comfortable, and the sound is amazing. As the title implies, I master audio so this is not a hollow endorsement. The cheap ones had hyped bass, missing mids, and painful presence/treble. These are very flat and well-performing by comparison, and can be EQ’d. The noise cancelling is also VERY respectable. I frequently work around loud sources and am sensitive to loud noises, and I have accidentally left these in when I intended to swap for earplugs, because the performance is similar.I love the app. Being able to select between audio quality vs. video sync’ing is awesome when I want to watch live musical performances where sync issues play with your mind. Being able to create custom EQ settings is very important to me too.The con is that you have to take them out of the case to power them on. It’s not a huge deal - it’s easy to pop them in for a split second if they’ve timed out or something. But there has been one occasion that I ran somewhere and forgot the case. I intend to live my life without dependence on crap like headphones, so no big deal - take a break.I would normally give something like this 4 stars because that power-on function is a notable miscalculation on JBL’s part, but it deserves a much better average review than it has so I’m doing my part to raise it. In everyday life it’s not that big of a deal unless you’re the kind of person who loves to find things to complain about.","Reviewed in the United States January 12, 2024",AFO7HNFRBAYYCEYUNPA4KKJ3ZWTA,1,104,Color: WhiteSize: SmallPattern: Earbuds,JBL Tune Buds,0.11212121212121212,0.4925833333333334,Neutral

These JBL Tune buds produce a good sound with my iPhone, especially when using the JBL app which has preset equalizer settings for different sounds and can deliver amazing base. Overall these are fairly good earbuds at a sale price of around $50. The box includes 3 pairs of silicon tips, small, medium and large, the silicon material is too smooth and too thin, they slide out easily and do not sit very securely for me, but this is very subjective and can be different for everyone. The noise canceling is only ok, in my opinion it provides about 40-50% background noise cancelation (personal opinion, not scientifically measured). The sound quality is very good but it seems the volume level seems low compared to other buds I have. The microphone seems to function well, I have not heard complaints from people I have called so I assume it is good.

R36AM1L7ZQ8OK5,B0C1QWWZR4,"5.0 out of 5 stars Fantastic sound, great battery life, a great buy!",TheRevenite,5,"I bought these on the Black Friday sale and man, I'm so glad I did. I have several pairs of the lesser Vibes, which sound good, but these blow them out of the water.First, let's address the fitment. I see many say they don't fit, they fall out, or feel like they're going to fall out. Don't put the large ear pads on if you don't have large ear canal openings! This will cause the earbuds to push themselves out. Too large will push them out, while too small will obviously not have enough to grip your ear. Test them all to find the right fit, if not, reach out to JBL, I'm sure they have replacement pads of other sizes. You can also buy them here on Amazon as they're pretty universal.I find pushing them in, and turning them into place, with the proper pads, netted a great seal and no falling out.You HAVE to install the app on your phone; otherwise, you're getting the flat sound your phone manufacturer decided sounded good. The JBL app is available for Apple and Android - and it makes a massive difference, especially with the noise cancellation and frequency response.With these, I'm hearing songs I've listened to for decades for the first time. I'm hearing effects and instruments I never heard in the music. These are that clear. They also don't kill my ears! I've tried earbuds from $5 to $300, and while the more expensive ones sounded terrific, they hurt my ears physically. With these, I get great sound and a great fit with a tremendous battery life.I'm reading a lot of negative reviews where either the fit or the sound is the problem. Most of these would be positive if people were provided with either longer pads so they go a bit further into the ear and more sizes and those with sound complaints would actually install the app. Mine sounded horrible with the Dolby equalizer baked into Android 13. Installing the app AND turning off any phone equalizer or sound enhancer was the solution. I'd definitely buy these again!","Reviewed in the United States November 29, 2023",AHRX7NNP5PFTRE7ODNC2FV7G3Q3Q,1,95,Color: BlueSize: SmallPattern: Earbuds,JBL Tune Buds,0.22002164502164503,0.5219725829725829,Positive

I have a few pairs of high-end (also expensive) wired headphones for indoor, critical listening. I also have a pair of inexpensive earbuds for exercise. The sound quality is obviously subpar. I have been looking for a replacement.I bought and returned many over the last couple years; none lived up to my standard. Most of them had poor sound quality. I did buy one pair last year that was decent, but it had connection problems. So I returned it.I pretty much gave up until I came across this one. The price was too good to pass up. It was delivered not quickly, but within the promised time frame. Given my experience, I have low expectations. But the JBL brand name does give me some hope of acceptable quality.BT Connection was fast and secure with no problems so far. Sound quality is much better than I expected, especially for the price. While the sound stage is not as open as my high-end wired headphones, imagining is excellent, which I did not expect. Tonal balance is also excellent with no treble fatigue or excessive bass; I set the equalizer to neutral flat. I can wear it for prolong periods.

Capsule charge was at 75% while both buds were at 100%.Next I tried placing them in my ears. When i placed them in my ears and turn them counterclockwise the weren't very comfortable and felt loose like they were going to fall out, however they did say in place when i tilted my head to either side and shook my head. These earbuds are supplied additional ear cushions. I tried the bigger ones and for my ears these were too big for my ear canal and would not stay in very well. I tried the smaller ones and these wouldn't hold in place. I'd like to say they were like Goldilocks and the 3 bears, but none were just right. The closest for me were the medium size, but I still didn't trust them staying in while doing yard work.Today was the first day I've had to really put them to the test. I place them in and fiddle with them for a bit to get a ""snug"" fit. The only way I could achieve this was by turning them so that the J in the JBL logo was at about a 180 degrees facing upwards.I started Spotify and proceeded to start the yard work. I noticed myself constantly fiddling with the earbud, because the kept feeling like the were going to fall out, enough so that I kept activating the voice pass through.After about a hour and a half into the yard work I was met with a bluetooth disconnected message. When I looked at my phone (Samsung galaxy s23 ultra) it showed bluetooth was enabled and the buds were paired. I started Spotify again and the music resumed. So I was like ok????I did about another 2 hrs of yard work and they stayed connected, but I still constantly felt they were going to fall out.With today's experience, I will not be using these near my poolWould I recommend these to a friend?

Now these I never had this issue. Over a wake they sync perfectly. Sounds amazing. Don’t feel them at all. So light. Now the complaint is the noise cancellation isn’t the best. It cancels about half the noise. But I don’t mind it because when the cancelling is too strong they give me a headache and I feel my eardrums are going to be sucked out. Highly recommend these I was sleeping on JBL FOR YEARS.Forgot to mention important. Very fast tap response.

For my ears, I can't get a super tight fit but that's not a design issue as I've always had this problem, I'll try some foam ear tips later. I would recommend these if your looking for sub $100 earbuds. Sometimes very slight artifacts in sound quality with noise cancelling on, ambient mode is nice if I'm walking and need to hear what's happening around me. Able to hear and have a conversation if needed without removing the earbuds.","Reviewed in the United States November 27, 2023",AGGCQV4ACO6SGFE63SPE5VUWHHZA,1,1,Color: BlackSize: SmallPattern: Earbuds,JBL Tune Buds,0.19046992481203007,0.590388471177945,Neutral

Mid and treble are the way it sounds perfect for the music, movie and podcast.But the issue is, it's not fit in ear perfectly, it tends to fall down from ear after some time specifically if your ear sweats.I also noticed while talking over the phone for a ling time, for the jaw movement it tends to come out from the ears. I twice face the issue and they dropped from about 5'6"" height and survived.Now, the Ambient sound mode is just a trash. Very little or no sounds are hearable from even 5ft distance. Talk through can help in that case, but talk through make the volume lower by default and can't increase at a certain level.ANC works fine at this price range, but a hissing sound is there and sometimes feels annoying while in between songs. But don't expect too much from this ANC.I used a similar product from Soundcore which is Sound Core life note 3i.The ANC and Ambient aware from that device is far better than this one for sure.","Reviewed in the United States January 13, 2024",AG4YCKW4BFTB5ZQYH7QNHJYF5CTA,1,5,Color: BlueSize: SmallPattern: Earbuds,JBL Tune Buds,0.16626587301587303,0.495968253968254,Neutral

On par with the good sounding off brand $30 sets. Big difference is that they have features that help with ambient sounds and has noise canceling. Thing though is I was very unimpressed with those features after owning a pair of Bose earphones. These were also really lightweight/cheap feeling compared to my Bose, and weren't as easy to use with the taps and stuff. Then there is the fitment issues. Do they have different size rubber pieces? Yes. 3 sizes, 1 set of each. None of them worked, to the point that almost every facial muscle movement or jaw movement caused them to fall out. Personally I like to be able to talk when I'm on a phone call, but these made it hard to. And trying to watch a movie while eating? Impossible! I spent more time catching/picking up my earbud and trying to resume the movie than I did eating.Ultimately my advice is that if you're not wanting to spend a lot of money on features like noise cancelation, take a chance with an off brand for a third of the price and you'll most likely still have the same sound quality. If you want thise features and are willing to pay this price, spend a little more and get Bose or a good brand that knows how to to it right.

R1D1C4VFKDYETP,B09CFP6J6D,"4.0 out of 5 stars Good Clarity and Dynamics, lack fullness",J,4,"I usually buy earbuds with a more balanced sound profile (Bose QuietComfort, Samsung Buds+, Jabra Elite 7 Pro). The same goes with Sony C500:1) The base is precise and it is not bloomy or overwhelming2) The treble is a little bright, but not harsh (Jabra Elite 7 Pro has a treble that hurts my ears). I use the equalizer to dial down the treble and dial up the mid just a bit to make it sounds slightly warmer.3) The mid is very detail. I can hear the singers express their emotions very clearly. Much more detail than Bose to my ears (but Bose sounds fuller and richer).4) The sound is dynamic. I feel it can bring out the excitement in music without being overwhelming (more than Bose but Bose has better instrument separation and ""layering"")Other Pros:1) It is super comfortable. I can listen to it many hours without taking it off.2) The equalizer is much better than Jabra. It shows the frequency as well as the decibel.A few things to watch out for:1) Even though the sound is very detail but it also sounds thin, especially for male vocals with deeper voice. Using the equalizer to dial up the mids helps a little bit.2) It sound pretty bad on voice calling.3) Noise Cancellation is not good. I can hear people chatting in the office. I guess it is a give-and-take. This earbud does not require a deep in-ear fit (to be comfortable), so it could be harder to get good noise cancellation. On the other hand, Jabra has good passive noise cancellation, but it is not nearly as comfortable (it has a deeper in-ear fit).I primarily look for a inexpensive earbuds to use in office with good sound and comfort. Given that I buy it on sale, I am happy with this investment. It has almost everything that I am looking for.

They stay in place very well during intensive workoutsSound quality: For the money, I've pretty impressed with the sound quality. I own an amp and DAC, planar magnetic headphones, and a pair of wired balanced armature earbuds. So I love good headphones. These give my balanced armature earbuds a good run for their money. These don't have huge bass, but the bass is punchy and well controlled. Highs and mids are good, and there's decent separation and a nice airiness about these. Overall, these have a very well controlled sound profile and work well with most any music genre. These also isolate pretty well, so good that I see no need for wireless buds with noise cancellation, which I personally think is a gimmick that only causes increased drain on the batteries.Battery life: pretty decent, these don't have noise cancelling tech, so battery life is much better than buds that have that tech. One important note, I've found the right earbud will drain faster than the left if I use it frequently to advance or replay tracks.Sony headphone app: I'd recommend downloading the Sony headphone app as this allows you some equalizer features and let's you turn off the buds using the app. Also, the app has some other bells and whistles like an ear analyzer that takes a picture of your ear and optimizes sound to fit your ears. However, you'll need to download one of several 3rd party apps to take advantage of this feature.Overall, these are a fantastic deal for the money, with typical Sony quality and functionality.

I wanted to write an honest review after using them for a while.I'm very happy with them. I tried a different brand but returned them after a couple days. These are heads and shoulder above those.I was concerned that they would fall out, but they fit snuggly, and they stay put without being uncomfortable. I use them when I workout, lifting, riding the bike or running, they have never fallen out. When I remove them, I have to gently tug on them for them to come out. Just make sure you are using the right size rubber attachments.I'm impressed with the sound quality. The app works well and you can actually hear the changes when you change modes.As far as noise cancellation--its more of the rubber inserts than the electronics IMHO. If I'm not listening to music or on a call they act like ear plugs. If you've ever talked wearing ear plugs, you know what I mean. However, when I'm walking the dogs or out in the wind, I can still hear the music with very little wind noise. It's almost as if I have over the ear headphones on.I'm still trying to determine the battery life. I wear them for a couple hours while exercising and a few hours after--I can wear them about 2 days like this until I need to recharge. I don't like to recharge until they are below 20%. The charging case will charge them up to about 75% in about an hour or less.I gave them a 4 because they are small and will sometimes slip out of my fingers when I remove them from my ears.I have the Bose noise cancelling over ear headphones and these are (almost) comparable to those for sound.","Reviewed in the United States March 26, 2022",AFXGIV2Y74ZI5ZM2XJJROSNCIHDA,1,1,Color: Black,Sony WF-C500,0.20418233082706766,0.6032685881370092,Positive

Motorola was a nice pair and no real complaints other than the select switch on the bud was very touchy but not a deal breaker...just be more careful.Out of the box on normal basic Sony settings I was twice as impressed by the sound quality as the MOTO. Down loaded the Sony app and it made a nice improvement but not overwhelmingly so. Having said that, this is my best favorite pair in the 10 pair in 4 yrs I have been using wireless earbuds. Battery bud is bigger than I like but not a deal breaker...stays in place, sound is the best I have yet heard in a pair of buds(a bit to much bass for me...I like more treble than most younger people so the app helped me there).For the price you can't be to unhappy with this pair.

R1ZPOE559OPBBT,B09CFP6J6D,4.0 out of 5 stars Very good,ariel villalona,4,"these in ears have several points to highlight.

1. Noise cancellation is passive, even with the headphones turned off, the outside noise is greatly reduced. Already with music on, it cancels out like 85% of the noise I feel this percentage lower depending on how loud the outside noise is.

2. The comfort is super super good, since I received them I use it 10 hours in a row every day, and it's as if I didn't have anything on. They don't fall off if I move my head, it doesn't bother, they fit well.

3. connectivity, the distance is very good. I can leave my cell phone in one place and walk around the house without losing sound quality.

4. I don't know if the battery is due to my use, but it lasts longer than the brand says. I charge them once every 3, 4 days.

5. the functions (buttons) are easy to use, and even though they are physical buttons, it doesn't bother to press them. And here's why I don't give them 5 stars:

when I use a single earphone, I lose all the functions of the headset that I'm not using. In my opinion, they should have kept the options of the right earphone, which are to change and pause the songs, because if I use only the left one I have to use the mobile phone if I want to pause or change a song.","Reviewed in the United States January 16, 2023",AF4LRKZWKMEVP4IL72OZQ6ZVAAKA,1,11,Color: Black,Sony WF-C500,0.24996031746031744,0.4591402116402117,Positive

I used them for about a week before the battery was even close to dying. And I don't use them just a few times a day, I listen to music bascally all day long after work and at gym. So I am extremely impressed with the battery life. Also, they feel very comfortable in your ear, you can barely feel they are in there. Another pro is that they are easy to store in their case and the case is small enough to put in your pocket to carry around. Cons: Doesn't have the best noise cancellation and volume is kind of low.

This set of earbuds absolutely surpassed my expectations for bluetooth audio quality; I even have a set of wired ones also by Sony that don't sound as good as these ones.I own a Galaxy/Android device, although the packaging claims that they only pair to Apple products, I had zero issues pairing my earbuds and their app is very user friendly. It's also a bonus that the case takes a USB Type C, same charging cord as my Galaxy phone and several phones out there (comes with cord too).The loudest of loud volumes can't even be heard from outside of the earbuds when correctly fitted to the ear, so you don't have to worry about being that guy with the loud heavy metal on your transit.My only complaint is that while you can seamlessly wear either earbud interchangeably, you cannot remap what functions the bud performs; right one does the pause-play functions while the left controls volume. I would just prefer pause-play on both, but maybe the volume function will grow on me. Also, the touch features for the earbuds are a press-down activation, not a finger sense, which I both prefer and kinda don't, depends on the earbud; this one does it right.To restate it, I am absolutely in shock at how good these wireless Sony earbuds are.

My first pair of another brand had to be returned because they rain out of battery time during the night, but they had the noise cancelling option.The Sony's do not have a the noise cancelling option, which is why, I guess, the play time is much longer than the other.They come with an app you can download which allows you to turn off ALMOST ALL of the voice commands that the other set would set off during the middle of the night. The caveat in the app setting is that it will still send what it considers to be ""important"" voice commands (I notice ""power on"" when first putting on).I would say the biggest negative is that, if wearing for sleep, the bud buttons can be set off easier than the other set I tried, but I tap the right one and it was back to the rain sound (Amazon prime music)Overall, a good earbud for sleeping, but have not used for daytime listening or phone usage.","Reviewed in the United States April 3, 2022",AE6TKNGDLNLFRMRPEJG7JNUT2MEA,1,1,Color: Black,Sony WF-C500,0.16130952380952382,0.37936507936507935,Neutral

It’s obvious I highly recommend these earbuds, but I’m not exaggerating. You’ll love them.One slight downside is sometimes when first connect them regularly the buds might get out of sync…don’t panic.

I will often wear these while mowing the lawn which can take ~5 hours. My ears never get sore with these earbuds. Second, the battery life is impressive. I've taken these on 5 day work trips out of town and used them moderately (~3-5 hours per day, calls and podcasts while walking) without plugging in to re-charge.

Apparently with this model disconnecting/unsyncing is a fairly common occurrence and there’s a whole series of steps you must take to get it to re-sync with your device. It’s not just a matter of putting them back in the case then turning them back on again. Less than one year after purchase, one side no longer holds a charge so that ear bud is effective worthless.

Mediocre sound quality even by Sony standards.,Persepolis,1,"This is on the cheaper end of Sony's offerings, given the price tag I would at a minimum expect good quality... wrong. It falls short of a 10 year old wired Sony MDREX58V, at 3x the price...Here are the pro's and con's:Pro: Quick bluetooth connect/disconnects.Con: Audio quality is just BAD... tinny and weak out of the box. It falls short of an older Sony MDREX58V I have which is only $20, it falls short of most $20-$30 no-name ear buds, and falls, and falls pretty close to a set of freebie earbuds I got while flying United a few years back. This is not good! I think Sony tried to differentiate between their high end offerings so badly that they killed the quality on this one so they can fill the lower price tier.Pro: Comfortable fit, lighter than some of the other ear buds I've used.Con: Software to control behavior is only available on Android and iOS... so if you're using it on a Windows PC, while it will pair and it will ""function"", it sounds like crap... and it will stay that way. In 2019, there were about 850mil iPhones in use... and about 900mil Windows PC's in use... not sure the what ledge the MBA's hit their heads on before deciding Windows users don't get the app thats needed to properly use these earbuds. For yuks sake, I do have both an iOS device and an Android... and installed the app on both of those... and the sound quality didn't get much better by adjusting the equalization envelope. Increasing the base just seemed to eat away at the midrange... It was weird to say the least.Pro: It can be reasonably loud. So you're getting mediocre sound, just loud mediocre sound... LOL.Anyways... summary: This is a low price offering from Sony that has been neutered so they can offer you something for $60... the only problem is that it performs worse than the $20 offering from others.Lack of a Windows app was not a particularly good decision given how low performing these are... a little bit of signal processing could have helped save these a bit...Summary: Save your money...

Not as deep base as the previous version of these... but they're smaller and less obvious in the ear, so I take the trade off. Connectivity is easy, and they're durable with an insanely great battery life. The only real negative is the main button (only in the right side) is large... perhaps too large.As I wear them longer, like all headphones they shift within my ears, so they require adjusting. This is where I often hit that large button while adjusting them into my ear. The previous version of these had a small button on the rim that was much more difficult to mistakenly hit.So just be aware, they function great... but be prepared for an accidental song pause (1 tap) or skip (2 taps) every now and then.","Reviewed in the United States March 28, 2022",AGON5T3NV4QR3Q5SATPFFFHLBBPQ,1,1,Color: Black,Sony WF-C500,0.10059523809523808,0.5517857142857142,Neutral

It was such an extended ordeal, I've no idear what was the final solve or how it finally worked. They weren't showing up on as an option to connect to even thought they were literally next to both my iPhone or my laptop and fully charged. Clearly the technology is wonky as it shouldn't take nearly an hour to connect a top-of-the-line device such as a $4K laptop or an iPhone with the most up-to-date iOs to connect.

The sound quality is pretty great, the battery life is exceptional, the range is good enough that I can take the garbage out without taking these out... There's very little to dislike.

The first is that, while the headphones recharge incredibly quickly in the carrying case (it takes about an hour for them to go from 0-100%, in my experience), the case itself charges pretty slowly. I would recommend charging it overnight. The second is that there are still some small technical problems. The headphones occasionally don't charge for whatever reason (this is typically fixed by just slightly moving them in their charging compartments), and I occasionally do need to restart my laptop to get them to reconnect. Neither of those are dealbreakers, and I would highly recommend these headphones, especially if they're going to stay at $70 for the foreseeable future.","Reviewed in the United States May 6, 2022",AFXXAW2WYTQ2O5REIUI5VSBC2KTQ,1,1,Color: Black,Sony WF-C500,0.15679924242424245,0.48249999999999993,Neutral

There are several different sizes of ""ear adapters"" they were all too large for my ears, as in they literally wouldn't fit into my ears. I had a smaller set of adapters that fit the ear buds and I used those. Another annoyance with these buds is there is a button on the entire surface of the bud. Anytime I go at adjust in my ear to secure it, almost 100% of the time, I inadvertently click the button which turns them off, or changes the volume or skips a song or any other thing that you weren't trying to do. I Do not recommend, wish I hadn't bought them.😕On a positive note, the charging case is effective, small, ready to go in your pocket or purse, they charge fast and have a fairly good amount of play time.","Reviewed in the United States April 6, 2022",AF3CAZXKWWKD7THCRRTG72W56WOQ,1,1,Color: Black,Sony WF-C500,0.19258658008658008,0.5374458874458874,Neutral

Also, personally have had a difficult time finding earbuds that fit well, and these do a decent job of not slipping out of my ears. I actually prefer that function buttons are mechanical switches rather than touch-sensitive. I bought a pair of Sony open-back Linkbuds that were over twice as expensive as these Sony Earbuds, and while the sound quality is much better I prefer to use these more often. The more expensive Linkbud's fit is constantly slipping. And because the functions are touch-sensitive on the Linkbuds, the simple act of adjusting the fit also usually triggered an unwanted function like change-volume or skip-track.

Sound quality is absolutely awful - OK-ish for podcasts where audio quality isn't a big factor, but for music? Forget about it. Super tinny and lacking in any depth or vibrance.Then there's the ergonomics. These are absolutely useless for working out. They fall out - constantly.

They also have buttons on the side for touch controls (pause/play, volume control, call pickup/end) and Sony allows for some sound customization in the app. Best part about them is that they are independent and each earbud (Left or Right) can be used alone unlike some other budget wireless earbuds.

R1G28XEXNA4QFG,B09CFP6J6D,5.0 out of 5 stars Sony Quality Shines Through with these Earbuds!,Shawshank,5,"I ordered these earbuds because I wanted a quality set of earbuds that weren't a cheap throwaway pair after a year but didn't want to drop the coin on a set of Apple or Bose earbuds. Sony has a good rep in the consumer electronics space and after doing a little research outside of Shamazon, I decided I would give the WF-C500's a shot. A few things I like about these specific buds.1. Fitment - they fit in my ears well and they stay in my ears without causing hot spots or pain points.2. Battery life - I can't give you a precise number, but I can use these earbuds throughout the day and even into the night and still have some battery life in the morning.3. Sound - These specific earbuds I use primarily for listening to Audible audiobooks, so I don't need an eardrum ticking base or eye-watering treble highs, that said I did test these out with a few of my favorite artists - Hank Williams, Willie Nelson, Armin Van Buuren, Tiesto, AC/DC, old Van Halen, Vivaldi, the usual stuff we all listen to and in each style of music, I was very pleased, it was accurately represented within the context of having a half thimble-sized device stuck in my ear. Win. I also use these for phone calls, when someone calls and interrupts my audiobook, and I've always gotten good feedback from the other person on the call, in terms of clarity, volume of voice, and even outdoors, the wind management seemed to not negatively impact my call.4. Earbud controls - There is a pro/con to the way you control these earbuds. I'll flat-out tell you I am not a fan of the touch-sensitive earbuds. I have big hand and rarely do I touch it in the way it wants to be touched and I end up hanging up on someone while I'm trying to turn up the volume or whatever the case is. The WF-C500's are more of a button-press kind of thing. It's tactile - you know exactly what your finger is doing when it's doing it because of that tactile feedback. I freaking love that. Super-duper simple!! So what's the con Shawshank? Glad you asked. It's probably a horrible habit but I use one of the earbuds when I go to sleep. Usually an audiobook, might be some Ludovico Einaudi, or that soothing ocean or thunderstorm sound with some good ol' scripture in the background. The problem is I'm a side-sleeper and SOMETIMES when I roll over to the side that has the earbud in it, the pillow will act like my finger and hit that little tactile button and pause whatever I'm listening to. I can hit it again and be a little more careful when I put my head back on the pillow, but that does happen. It's probably a bad habit anyway, but that's the con of the controls on these earbuds, from my POV anyway.5. Overall quality - I really can't complain about these earbuds. I've dropped them in the sink while washing my face, and forgotten to take them out when taking a shower (I realized after the water hit my head that I was still listening to whatever it was I was listening to, but they got a good dose of water sprayed on them, and there were times where one did fall out of my ear, primarily because I didn't seat it well.I have been so pleased with these earbuds, that I bought my 17 yr old son a pair and he is also very happy with them. He listens to music primarily, 70-80-90's music (yeah he has good taste in music for a teenager.) :-)An update after I had written this. I ran into a problem with the left earbud not connecting to BT. I contacted Sony support because they have a 1 yr limited warranty, and I bought these back in May of last year. We tried doing a full reset, which didn't correct the problem. The CSR provided me the info to send them back, I received an email with a FedEx shipping label, dropped them off at the Fedex in a Dollar General nearby, 2 days later they arrived at the Sony repair facility, 1 day after that, Sony notified they had ordered a brand new pair of WF-C500's for me and I should get them next week.I'm not usually the kind of guy that gets massively butt-hurt when something breaks. Stuff happens. What I don't enjoy is when I am trying to correct a problem, be it a defect or whatever, with the manufacturer or the store and it becomes a battle of will and plain old integrity of service. My experience with Sony was outstanding. They asked me to try and correct the issue by doing a hard reset and when that didn't work, they moved right into replacement mode. I dig and respect that. So I wholeheartedly recommend this product. Unlike the growing number of Shamazonians who get free stuff to test and write reviews even though in all honestly sometimes they don't know crap about the product, I am a guy who buys his own stuff and in this case, I was 110% daily user of these Sony WF-C500 earbuds - at home, in my truck, at the gym, in the kitchen, in the bathroom (oops), outside mowing my grass and running my airplane sounding weedeater, in all cases this audio was good, and most importantly, I didn't lose one out of my ear and run my mower over it. As far as ""noise cancellation"", I will just refer to the numerous times my bride yelled at me because I didn't hear her when she was talking to me. I suppose in some regards that counts as ""noise cancellation"". (my beautiful Brazilian bride, if you happen to read this, you know your man loves ya.)BLUF (Bottom Line Up Front): They feel good in the ear. They sound good in the ear. You don't look like you have a Chernobyl growth sticking out of your ears like some of the other earbuds. Perhaps best of all - Sony sticks behind their products and they understand what excellent customer service should be. These are the factors that drive my review and are the reason I bought a pair for my son, to whom I don't give him a rock when he asks for bread if you know what I mean. But he never asked for these, I knew the pair he had for 3+ years was having issues and wanted to surprise him. He was surprised on top of being happy. That's probably the highest recommendation I can provide, for what I give to the absolute pride and joy of my life - well I can't see these not being good enough for the King of England if they're good enough for my son.I'll TRY to remember and update my review with some pics when I get the new earbuds. Chances are however, that I will forget and probably remember when I'm in a situation that precludes me from executing the review update in that moment I'm thinking about it. But I'll try. BTW the price dropped on these. I paid $90 bucks for my pair and my sons pair, and I think I saw them for $70ish or $79 and they are worth every buck of that even at $90.","Reviewed in the United States February 23, 2024",AE46KEUAAPWZ3CWV3BKSR4PTUBSA,1,8,Color: Black,Sony WF-C500,0.22683877611062078,0.5139752238053208,Positive

First off, I have spent over 20 years in the audio industry and consider myself myself somewhat of an audiophile - so sound quality is very important. Unfortunately, that time in the audio industry listening at high DBs has no doubt cost me some hearing - so strong volume is also very important to me.Thanks to Amazon's return policy I have tried many highly rated ear buds under $100 on the market:Ear Fun Free Pro 2 = Great sound, great NC, good volume but would NOT stay in my ears,Soundcore Anker Life P3 = great sound quality, features, but NOT loud enough.SoundPeats MiniPro AC = Great volume, good sound but stick out way too far and fall out of my ears.Palm Buds Pro = just not loud enough!Soundcore Life A2 NC+ = Great Sound, Great volume, great features but stick out too far and also fall out of my ers!Now on to these Sony WF-C500s = Great sound, very good volume, 10 hour battery life, well designed case, nice app, and fit my ears like a glove. Heck I can even side sleep and not usually press a control accidentally, I have had no problems with people hearing me on phone calls. I can work out and they don't fall out of my ears! While they are not overly bass heavy (more true to the music), it can't be beefed up with the EQ in the app. I made a Custom EQ with pretty much the same settings as the Treble Boost EQ but raised the Clear Bass setting. The result is more than adequate bass, good separation and very good volume. I ordered all the above buds about the same time and when I tried these Sony's I figured they were the keeper. After trying all the others I mentioned, I kept coming back to these WF-C500s!

They're alright.They stay in my ears surprisingly well, the battery lasts much longer than I'll ever need it to. The case is made of a pretty cheap feeling plastic, but the buds themselves feel higher quality.My main issue with these is that the audio quality (by default, at least) is HORRIBLE. Maybe I'm just spoiled by higher quality, wired earbuds but they are far below average by most standards. The saving grace, however, is that the app lets you tamper with the different levels and tune the audio to your liking. I managed to get it to sound a bit better, but I couldn't find a way to make the audio any louder which is unfortunate. The buds are very quiet.Overall they're pretty good.

The comfort level isn't great although it depends on earsand type and size of the tips, ok, they fit snug, they charge easily and last a long time on charge,very convenient for running around town, etc. walks, exercise, shopping, etc. However, with myiPhone or lossless player, I never, ever achieve the type of power and volume and quality levelsthat I get with my full wired headphone amp/player Fiio rig. These get somewhat loud butnot very, they seem to be limited to a certain threshold and it doesn't matter what the sourceis. I never have those issues with my full wired headphone and IEM rig.For serious listeningI would opt for the latter, always, but the Sony C500 are good when I just want to run aroundtown and even drive and cannot use the full rig I have. The comfort level wasn't great,though, which is a reason I often don't love IEMs or earbuds. For the money these soundpretty good, clear, but I cannot get the type of audiophile performance from them I wouldhope for, due to the wireless, so I guess I just don't love wireless so far. Meanwhile I owna brand new 70 watts per channel BT speaker that blows these earbuds out of the waterin every respect. But that's a fully amped full range portable speaker.Until Sony and other mfgrs. come up with a fully built-in self-amplified BT IEM or earbud,these will be for convenience only, really.

Overall they sound pretty good for under $50. The 2 issues I encountered are:1) They don't get loud enough. I used them while I was mowing my lawn and the noise cancelling gets rid of some of the background noise, but not enough to immerse a person in their music if there's something loud in the background.2) They don't go deep enough into the ear canal. In ear monitors need to couple with your ear canal in order to stay in place and reproduce low frequencies well. This made them very light in the bass and if I tried to boost the bass with my phone's EQ, it would start to distort at ""high"" volumes.If they went about a 1/4"" deeper it might take care of both problems. I'll probably look for different ear pieces to attach to these that will go deeper into the ear canal.","Reviewed in the United States October 23, 2023",AGRARCPQFSTBNWQ5KGBZCYQ3YNMA,1,11,Style: Earbuds with Noise Cancelling,Panasonic ErgoFit True Wireless Earbuds,0.16000000000000003,0.5805555555555555,Neutral

R1UP1UTTWDI6CH,B0BZTCXG6T,5.0 out of 5 stars Very nice,Bridgette,5,"Being a huge fan of the Panasonic ergofit wired buds, these were a prime choice for my first pair of Bluetooth earbuds ever. Suffice to say I love Bluetooth earbuds now and will never go back to wired. These buds are great. The charge lasts forever. With a good custom EQ, and Dolby Atmos ON, they provide very nice bass and clear voices. The sound quality is on par with the wired version, all things being equal, as these do have the extra bass from their larger drivers.The buds are black, clean, and no fuss with a neat little angle in them for the ""ergo-fit"" gimmick. I don't think they fit any better than other earbuds, but they do look nice. The buds are also quite large with their 10mm drivers, almost seeming oversized. This gives them a more expensive look.Unlike my husband's other brand of wireless buds, these buds have NO LEDs on the buds themselves, which I quite enjoy. No annoying red/blue lights blinking constantly, and also saves battery, I imagine.Pairing was very simple and quick on my S20 Ultra, without reading any instructions whatsoever, and just opening the case, they immediately showed in the Bluetooth connection and paired quickly. They seem to pair far faster and more reliably than my husband's wireless buds. Simply turn bluetooth on, and tap ""RZ-B310W"". My husband's initial set up for his buds was an annoying dance of pairing each bud separately, and opening and closing the case. These buds both pair at same time, every time for me, and can connect even when they're inside the case charging.The case is nice, minimalistic and has a nice magnetic snap close. No LED screen like my husband's earbuds, but I find that an unnecessary expense. There's a little red LED light to show when it's charging. The tiny case holds many hours of charge, and I'm surprised daily that the buds just keep going, even though I'm wearing them a good portion of the day.The buds snap magnetically into their ports, and I will admit it can be a pain when you go to put them back in figuring out which one goes in which port, as they only go in one way.The buds fit in my ears is ""OK"", not perfect. I have small ear canals. They do stay in, but I can tell when the seal gets broken if I smile or laugh and they move out of place the tiniest bit.That's a small annoyance rather niche for people with tiny ear canals like myself though.I never read the instructions so figured out by trial and error how to activate the different modes and things like pause. Currently to change mode, I cup my palm against the bud as if to push it further in my ear for a couple seconds until I hear the voice over saying what's been activated. Still haven't figured out exactly where to touch and hold with one finger to change modes, but my way works for me.To pause/play, I press a fingertip against the round back of the bud. Unfortunately it's probably quicker to just use your phone to pause/play, as you cannot just tap the bud but have to press and hold for a second. On the other hand, that's a positive as it's much harder to accidentally hit it, unlike my husband's buds, where he often hangs up mid-call because he pushed the bud for a split second to get it back in his ear fully.So, about the noise cancellation, it's pretty nice! There's definitely a noticeable difference between the three modes. I didn't buy these for noise cancelling, but wanted to try it out as I've never had noise cancelling buds.There's ""Ambient Sound"", which amplifies your surrounding noise to hear comfortably even while wearing earbuds. Makes hearing others, and safety sounds like traffic, loud and clear. Not ideal to use when just chilling at home, as it makes surrounding noise very loud, but great in public or if walking/jogging/biking on a road or having a conversation with someone else.There's the option ""Off"" which seems to be just the default experience of wearing normal earbuds. Sound is slightly muffled, but still comes through.Finally, the option for ""Noise Cancelling"", which is quite striking when you use it for the first time. In my room with an AC on and white noise in the background, it dramatically lowered the apparent noise coming into my ears to a near imperceptible whisper. If I didn't know better, I would've thought there was NO AC or white noise in my room and it was near-silent.So, the noise cancellation works great for continuous sounds, yes. But other dynamic noises like human voices, it doesn't work as well. If you are buying these for the noise cancelling element, like if you, say, live in a noisy house and want to sleep better at night, I'd choose a more robust set with great active noise cancelling. Or if you just want to drown out ALL noise around you. But I will say, with noise cancelling on, and some brown noise playing on the buds from YouTube, that would provide a good night's sleep in a noisy home for sure, and it's been done many times by myself since getting these buds.... Only issue is finding them in the morning as they inevitably fall out with my tossing and turning!But I didn't buy these for noise cancelling, though it was a gimmick I wanted to try. I bought these for sound quality, and they deliver, when set up correctly. I've never been one to just use the default sound settings on my phone/PC for any pair of buds I've had, but my initial impression from the DEFAULT EQ on my S20 Ultra was that, out of the box, the buds were too bass-forward for me, at the loss of necessary mids and highs. They sounded a bit, muffled. In music, I prefer the voice to be at the forefront and crystal clear in the genres I enjoy. I also listen to a lot of podcasts, so I quickly did a custom EQ to suit my needs, and I recommend everyone does for *any* pair of headphones they have, as it can make a huge difference. I do listen to rap and hip-hop occasionally, but if that is your *predominant* preference, these may be perfect for you out of the box without adjustment. For other genres and general listening, in my opinion, these are too bassy. I want the bass to be there, but not as front as it comes in these earbuds.There's a nifty setting on the newer android phones to make a custom EQ right in the sound settings without a separate app, and even a way to get a personalized EQ by testing your hearing, to adjust for the loss of perception that comes with age. I recommend playing around with that and making your own custom equalizer to suit your needs if you don't like the initial sound quality.It's exceedingly rare I get a pair of headphones that sound to my liking out of the box, as these days heavy bass is so championed.All that being said, I'm very satisfied with my first set of wireless buds, and I think Panasonic knocked it out of the park at this price point, just like they did with the ergo-fit wired buds I've loved for years.","Reviewed in the United States June 24, 2024",AEYM6LOYQKQ5PPKYPSKIHFOCX3GQ,0,0,Style: Earbuds with Noise Cancelling,Panasonic ErgoFit True Wireless Earbuds,0.16808683853459974,0.5109083909457043,Neutral

R3NPY1F9JHC976,B0BZTCXG6T,4.0 out of 5 stars Quite impressive,Yan L.,4,"The Panasonic ErgoFit True Wireless Earbuds with Noise Cancelling have impressed me with their exceptional sound quality and convenient features. From their sleek design to their powerful audio performance, these earbuds provide a satisfying listening experience that will elevate your music enjoyment.The first thing that caught my attention was the ergonomic design of the earbuds. They fit snugly and comfortably in my ears, thanks to the multiple sizes of ear tips included in the package. The lightweight construction ensures extended periods of use without discomfort, making them suitable for daily activities or intense workout sessions.The sound quality delivered by these earbuds is truly remarkable. The built-in noise cancelling technology effectively blocks out ambient noise, allowing you to fully immerse yourself in your favorite tunes. The audio is crisp, clear, and well-balanced, with a particular emphasis on the powerful bass response. The XBS (Extra Bass System) feature adds depth and richness to the low-end frequencies, enhancing the overall listening experience, especially for bass enthusiasts.With Bluetooth 5.3 connectivity, pairing the earbuds with my device was seamless and hassle-free. The wireless connection remained stable even when moving around, and I experienced minimal latency while watching videos or playing games. The touch controls on the earbuds provide easy access to playback controls, volume adjustment, and even voice assistant activation, making it convenient to manage your audio on the go.The included charging case is compact and sleek, serving as a secure storage solution for the earbuds while also providing additional battery life. The case's built-in battery can recharge the earbuds multiple times, ensuring that you can enjoy your music throughout the day without worrying about running out of power. The USB-C charging port offers fast charging capabilities, minimizing the downtime between listening sessions.While the Panasonic ErgoFit True Wireless Earbuds deliver excellent sound quality and convenient features, there are a few areas where they could be further improved. The battery life of the earbuds themselves could be extended, as they offer around 4-5 hours of continuous playback, which may not be sufficient for long trips or extended listening sessions without access to the charging case. Additionally, the touch controls on the earbuds can sometimes be overly sensitive, leading to accidental commands.Overall, the Panasonic ErgoFit True Wireless Earbuds with Noise Cancelling offer an impressive audio experience, combining powerful bass, effective noise cancelling, and convenient features in a compact design. Whether you're a music lover, a fitness enthusiast, or someone who appreciates wireless freedom, these earbuds deliver on their promise of immersive sound and provide great value for their price.","Reviewed in the United States June 13, 2023",AEG5NYGZDCB5CQWBIIR2YPNZFQQA,0,4,Style: Earbuds with Noise Cancelling,Panasonic ErgoFit True Wireless Earbuds,0.2954248366013072,0.5764705882352941,Positive
R1GTMZ7X8PAZVM,B0BZTCXG6T,4.0 out of 5 stars A good performer,WT,4,"The Panasonic RZ-B310W is not currently compatible with the Panasonic Audio Connect app so you are limited to the controls available on the earbuds and there isn't an equalizer. Controls available using the touch panels on the earbuds include music control (pause, forward, backward) and sound control (ANC, ambient sound, off). Unfortunately, sound control toggles from ANC to Off to Ambient Sound. This means it takes two touches to go from ANC to Ambient Sound and I find that to be a bit annoying. I prefer going from ANC to Ambient to Off. You can also turn the buds on or off using the touch panels. The earbuds are lightweight, comfortable and fit my ears well. I can get a good seal using the included eartips and the sound isolation is very good. Construction quality is excellent as you would expect from Panasonic. The charging case is small and will easily slip into a pocket.The earbuds are tuned too bright for my liking. I use the equalizer in my music app to tune the earbuds. The bass is strong without being boomy but sounds a bit loose. The overall sound signature is V-shaped but pleasing to the ear. However, you must get a good seal or the sound is really messed up, with little bass, no midrange and shrill highs. These earbuds are not for critical listening but if you want something for casual listening while commuting or working at your desk, give these a try.Noise isolation and bass response depends on your achieving a good fit with one of the included eartips. If you can't get a good seal, the bass will be nearly non-existant and the treble will overpower everything.Active noise cancellation is better than I expected. It isn't at the level of the Sony WF-1000XM4 or Bose QuietComfort Earbuds 2 but it does reduce a significant amount of low frequency noise, like the roar of jet engines. To be honest I wasn't expecting this level of noise cancellation in a $99 earbud. It also does a fair job of reducing office noises.I don't normally use earbuds to make to take calls so I haven't checked the voice quality during calls.Overall, I'm very pleased with the RZ-B310W. I can easily recommend them as one of the best I've used under $100.

RYSBT2D2ZXIFR,B0BZTCXG6T,3.0 out of 5 stars Fine for the Price - But I Have Quirks,Romain,3,"Overall, I think these earbuds are good for the price point, but it has a few quirks that make using them less enjoyable.Sound Quality is its best feature. I tested them against my son's AirPods Gen 2 and my AirPod Pros Gen 1 on an iPhone via Apple Music. My go to song to test listening devices is Ray Charles ""Georgia on my Mind"" (mid volume). That song has a lot happening, and I can pick-up how well the device is as letting you hear all the details. I thought the Panasonic sounded better than the AirPod, and it held its own against the AirPod Pro. Had I played other songs, I think the Pro would win outright because of Spatial Audio features. For added fun, I listen to the track with a wired Beats earbud (lighting cord), and that beat all 3 of them.Ergonomics is Terrible. As others have mentioned, just to get it out of the case is a challenge, if you have larger fingers. When you take it out of your ears, it still plays. That is not necessarily a bad thing, but worth nothing. The case is nice looking but it does not have a sturdy feel. I case see it cracking with a moderate fall to the ground.Software and Other Quirks makes it hard to love. To start, there was no feedback on the case to tell you when it was fully charged, charging the case or charging the ear buds. Same goes with low battery. I could not make out when I needed to charge it, other than waiting for it to not play or connect. Perhaps the app is suppose to help with that? With a good app, it probably would be manageable.It's a very possessive device. As mentioned, I have multiple buds. If I start using the Panasonics, and decide to switch to another device, the Panasonics kept trying to jump back in, even when the buds were in the case. I don't know if I got a bad one or what, but a few times I had to move it away from my phone to get it to not try to take over.If it will be your only bluetooth listening device, and you don't plan on using the buttons, I think it would be fine. For me, I am already slotting the Panasonics as my TV at night device or another dedicated source to avoid it getting confused.","Reviewed in the United States May 17, 2023",AEYMAQNZ7LDD6SWFBFCYN7UCFBLA,0,6,Style: Earbuds,Panasonic ErgoFit True Wireless Earbuds,0.11354166666666667,0.42786458333333327,Neutral
R2VOU38A4NGX3B,B0BZTCXG6T,3.0 out of 5 stars Touch controls are difficult to use and don't work with Android phone,Olivia,3,"These headphones have some positives, but in general I don't think they are worth the money. You can get better earbuds for cheaper than this.To start with, the things I like about them: the fit. I like that they are angled into my ears, and stay in very securely. They come with different headphone tips, although the default ones were just fine for me. I've used these while running and don't slip around or start to fall out.I think the sound is decent -- not great, but not terrible. The bass is well balanced. I also use these for video calls and people report they can hear me well. In video calls, other people's voices sound slightly harsh, which I don't love. But they are definitely servicable sound. If you're really into audio balancing, you probably won't like these, though.The noise cancelling is also somewhat mediocre. I can kinda tell it's doing something, but when people are talking nearby or my dogs bark elsewhere in my house, I can hear it. They don't have the kind of noise cancelling where you put on and remove your headphones and can really notice the difference the noise cancelling makes.The thing I like the least about these are the touch controls. They are really tough to get to work and they don't work beyond play/pause with my Android phone (Pixel 7 pro). When I use these paired to my computer, I have to really focus on how I tap and where exactly my finger lands to get the controls to respond. If I'm wearing these out while running, I have to stop running and hold still to get the play/pause to work. Otherwise, if I'm paired with my phone, I can't get it to advance/repeat track or change volume. I tried downloading the Panasonic devices app, thinking that might be the issue, but I can't get that to work at all (it never pairs with the headphones and is stuck in a loop).In the end, these aren't worth the money to me. I'd rather spend more for a more solid product that works, like Airpods or GalaxyBuds, or go for a cheaper pair that might not have the nice fit, but has more functional touch controls.","Reviewed in the United States June 4, 2023",AGNYUVQAVT6VARWZ5ZNRSFDH3BNQ,0,6,Style: Earbuds with Noise Cancelling,Panasonic ErgoFit True Wireless Earbuds,0.20422558922558923,0.5077272727272727,Positive
R1X5DJA9RJ2OID,B0BZTCXG6T,4.0 out of 5 stars Punchy sound and a comfortable fit,expatbrit,4,"These are impressive earbuds that do a lot of things right and only come up short in 2 areas.The sound is bass heavy, as expected from the XBS feature, and it can produce some really meaty lows, but this can be dialed down with a good equalizer.Out of the box they sounded a little underwhelming but they improved steadily after a dozen hours or so. I still prefer the more enveloping sound of my Soundpeats buds, but these are more than acceptable, especially with a high bit rate streaming service.There's plenty of volume on tap and the Bluetooth range is a little more than 30 feet, about par for the course across similar products.Panasonic is always good at proving clear instructions, but only the quick start guide is useful here, with picture based instructions. The little booklet offers safety advice in multiple languages, an odd inclusion.One thing these RZs excel at is comfort. Once you find the right rubber tips (3 sizes included) then they stay put, some of the best I've tried. Even talking and eating couldn't shift them, a rare find in my experience. These would make excellent buds for the gym.Battery life is a key selling point on the box, and it's proving correct so far; with minimal charging and extended use, no 'battery low' warning yet. Charging is via a USB C type port, widely becoming the standard these days.One downside is the fiddly shape of the bud and the case, it's all too smooth with no real area to grip, so getting them out of the case takes practice. The touch controls are also slow to respond but work well enough once you get the right zone at the top of the stalk.There's no noise cancelling to speak of (I have tested them on a plane) but they don't claim to have it, so that's OK.For the user looking for a good all-round set of wireless buds, from a household name that will almost certainly be around to honor a warranty in years to come, these are a solid value.","Reviewed in the United States June 1, 2023",AFMRUDC57F6M2LQATDMSNGXBHU3A,0,3,Style: Earbuds,Panasonic ErgoFit True Wireless Earbuds,0.19891237447359889,0.5059345643019113,Neutral
R2E8WJH3WQ07TL,B0BZTCXG6T,4.0 out of 5 stars An affordable option that deliver good results on sound quality and functionality,Kevin,4,"Although I am not a power-user when it comes to wireless earbuds, I am picky when it comes to comfort, and most importantly, sound quality. For may years now I have used AirPods and AirPods Pro models. I have generally been very satisfied with them, with the latter being a little less comfortable for me than I would prefer, and sound quality of both being on the above average side. And as far as functionality, they have worked pretty much flawlessly for me.When I saw these Panasonic ErgoFit earbuds, they seemed to boast the features that I tend to look for – good sound, Bluetooth connectivity, noise cancelling, a portable charging case – and of course, good sound quality with good base.My overall impression of the Panasonic’s is on the good side of the spectrum. As far as sound quality, in my opinion, I have found them to be on par with my AirPod Pros, and better than my standard AirPods, but that should be expected given that the Panasonics seal in your ears just like the AirPod Pros do. I’ve also found the noise cancelling and ambient sound modes to work very well. I would however give the edge to the Pros on ambient sound mode. The Panasonics have something of a white-noise in the background when using ambient sound mode, and it is noticeable when you are not playing music.On phone calls, I can hear very clearly, and based on my testing, callers can also hear me very clearly, so the microphones do a very good job on phone calls. I would say that they seem to pick up a little more ambient noise than my AirPods, and callers can hear more background noise when speaking to me. But overall, unless you are doing something noisy, they work fine.As far as fitment goes, I’ve found these to be bulkier than my Airpods and AirPod Pros. I would also say they are just slightly less comfortable than the Pros as well. But, given the activities that I use “ear-sealing” earbuds for, like jogging, mowing the lawn and working outside, I find them to be more than comfortable enough. Comfort is very subjective, so these may or may not be a good option for you.As to overall build quality, the Panasonic earbuds themselves feel solid and well made. The case on the other hand has something of an empty feeling to it, unlike the Apple cases which feel sturdy and well made. But regardless, the case works just fine, which ultimately is what matters.I have noticed that the Bluetooth connection with the Panasonics is not as resilient as it is with either pair my AirPods. In an open and unobstructed environment, the reliability of the connection, and the range of the connection is perfectly fine. However, if you introduce obstructions and if you change the orientation of your body, you will start losing the connection. If you keep your phone on your person this should not be a problem, but I like to place my phone down somewhere safe while I am mowing or if I am working on projects outdoors, and I have been annoyed by the tendency of the connection to drop more often than the AirPods do.So overall, what do I think about the Panasonic ErgoFit earbuds? Well, I like that you can get good sound quality while listening or speaking - and out of earbuds for under $100 dollars as not everyone has the money to purchase more expensive options. While the Panasonics lack some of the refinement of more expensive units, they put out good sound and offer the convenience of a portable charging case like their more expensive cousins. For working out, working outdoors, or just working around the house while jamming some tunes, I see these as an affordable option that shouldn't disappoint you, particularly as these are a value item in my opinion.

The sound was amazing, and I was able to focus on what I was doing and what I was listening to instead of all the chaos around me... but the sound from all the other teachers talking and joking around me was not completely canceled. It was more like hearing them from underwater: I was aware of the sound, the tempo or cadence of people speaking, but couldn't make out what they were saying and a couple of times I had to figure out that someone was talking to me because they were trying to make eye contact. I could hear them speaking, but could not make out the words.They are very comfortable, and they last for a long time, and I think they are a good level of noise limiting, but not quite canceling.","Reviewed in the United States August 16, 2023",AGLLV5CA5XAOSRIYRED2MGJUPR6Q,0,1,Style: Earbuds with Noise Cancelling,Panasonic ErgoFit True Wireless Earbuds,0.3232352941176471,0.4862745098039216,Positive
R3EDW5KWXBF5HI,B0BZTCXG6T,4.0 out of 5 stars I would order these again!,Customer Review,4,I ordered these for myself because my old earbuds stopped charging. These are a little bit too big for my ears but I have small ear canals. I would say for most folks these are going to be a nice and snug fit. They are comfortable and I don't even notice they are in my ears. I must say the sound quality is very good to excellent and the noise canceling really does block out noises in your immediate environment. These are the most expensive earbuds I have owned so far and I am not an expert at listening to music with earbuds. They were easy to connect with my Android Note 9 phone. The case has a built-in battery that recharges the earbuds as needed. A USB-C cord is provided and does a great job of fast charging (the webpage states a 15-minute charge gives 60 minutes of playback). I don't use them often but I would say I can use them both for roughly 5 hours plus on a single charge. The instructions state you can get 26 hours by using the charging case.

RQZ41ITP5MOLF,B0BZTCXG6T,2.0 out of 5 stars Disappointing,Rob M.,2,"I have owned and tested dozens of true wireless earbuds over the past few years.I really wanted to like these earbuds, but they have too many flaws. There are better choices out there at this or lower price points.Pros- Small, pocketable case- Good build quality. Solid Panasonic reputation.- Very comfortable ""Ergofit""- Minimal in-ear adjustment required after insertion. They stay in place pretty well for non-winged earbuds, but do require infrequent adjustments in my wonky ears.- Sound quality is very good, even without EQing. Balanced. Good ""XBS"" bass, good treble. Compared to Soundcore Liberty 3 Pro, they rate 8/10 on sound.Cons- No wireless charging- A little awkward to get in and out of the case- No app support, which means no firmware updates to potentially improve them over time.- No app means no control customization.- No app means no EQ unless you use a 3rd-part EQ app like Wavelet, XEQ, or your music player's built-in EQ.- Cannot control volume from the earbuds, aside from summoning the digital assistant and asking it to turn the volume down. Cumbersome. Faster to just do it on your phone.- Controls are just OK. Sometimes you have to tap more than once to get them to register. And they seemed to respond more when I tapped below the visible sensor area than on it, but that's probably something I could adjust to in time.- ANC - The noise cancelling is just OK. It does work, and there is a marked difference between Off, Transparent Mode, and Noise Cancelling Mode. But it is not nearly as good as the Pixel Buds Pro, Liberty 3 Pro, or Earfun Free Pro 2.- Bluetooth connection stability. They have Bluetooth 5.3, as does my Pixel 7 phone. Despite un-pairing and re-pairing several times with my phone, they would frequently lose pairing, then re-pair. Sometimes they would not re-pair or re-connect without putting them back in the case and pulling them back out. During playback, they would have several very short interruptions or glitches per song. Very quick, like a record skipping, but still quite noticeable and aggravating. Sometimes when grasping the stem to adjust their fit in my ear, they lose connection and say ""pairing"". If buds can't stay connected, they are useless. I don't have these problems with other buds.- As is true with most buds, if they lose seal the sound quality degrades a lot. No bass, shrill treble, and no ANC because of outside sound leakage. You have to adjust them to get the seal and the bass back. But there's a 50/50 chance they'll lose connection when you grasp the stem to adjust.- Phone voice quality is just OK. The clarity is fine, but the volume is quiet. Callers have a hard time hearing me unless I speak quite loudly.I don't feel these buds are worth $100. They have a solid Panasonic brand name & build quality, but they offer too little for the money. A $50-65 price point is more realistic for these buds.Soundcore Liberty 3 Pro list for $169 but are frequently discounted to $129 or even $99.Earfun Free Pro 2 or Air Pro 3 are less than $99.Pixel Buds Pro list for $199 but are often on sale for $149.I would choose any of those over these Panasonics.","Reviewed in the United States May 12, 2023",AHO6IVLXFOSTQ3IH3LQPY7SUUWHA,0,2,Style: Earbuds with Noise Cancelling,Panasonic ErgoFit True Wireless Earbuds,0.14602914389799634,0.4321129326047359,Neutral
R3CKS394UB0G6W,B0BZTCXG6T,"4.0 out of 5 stars Lots of bass, ANC, ambient mode, not the most comfortable.",Avid83,4,"These Panasonic earbuds are awesome for listening to music with deep bass. They connect easily to your iPhone or PC via Bluetooth and have a stable connection. They come with different sizes of rubber tips, but they could fit better in your ears. Maybe longer stems would help. Fortunately, these are lightweight, but not the most compact design.The earbuds have some cool features like noise cancelling, ambient mode, and a low latency mode called “game mode.” You can turn on game mode by tapping the earbuds 5 times quickly. It makes games and videos in sync, but sometimes it’s prone to dropouts. Active noise cancelling works well at reducing outside sounds, but also introduces some low but noticeable noise. I didn’t try exercising with these, but they do have an IPX4 water resistant rating.The touch sensors on these earbuds are not very responsive and have a delay. You have to get used to them and find the right spot to tap. You can't control the volume with them, but you can do other things like skip tracks, pause, answer calls, and use voice assistants. The earbuds don't fall out of your ears, but they do slip a bit over time and have to be readjusted. Battery life seems good, and the charging case uses a USB-C connection, although the included cable fits unusually tight.Although not perfect, these earbuds have a lot of modern features like ANC and a USB-C connection to charge the case.

If I leave out of the room the sound immediately starts getting choppy and eventually disconnects. And the rooms in my house aren't large. Also, sometimes it will randomly disconnect then reconnect even though I'm right in front of my phone. I'm not sure why this happens.The mic quality is good. I haven't had any issues while on calls.

Since Panasonic is a brand I grew up around, I had high hopes for these earbuds.These paired easily with my phone, and they're comfortable on my ears for their whole two and a half hour battery life.These earbuds are a pain to get out of the case, even with my small hands and somewhat long nails.The controls are AWFUL. They're difficult to master, rarely react the same way twice except to pause when I'm trying to skip, I cannot skip songs nor activate the ANC, and there's very little about the controls in the instruction booklet aside from a leaflet with mostly pictures- the other booklet is a European warranty that lacks a language that I can understand. I have no clue what the picture means for how to activate the ANC, so I gave up on that front. I can just barely get these to answer calls, so I don't bother. I use my phone's controls over the ones on these earbuds, they're so difficult to work with.I have to turn off my phone's bluetooth to disengage these earbuds from it.The volume on these is not stellar- at their max, I'm just barely satisfied with the volume, even when using VLC. Sometimes I want louder music to drown out construction work and the industrial-level banging at the nearby oil well- these cannot do that.However I do find that the sound is overall reasonably balanced, and the strength of the bass is adequate- but not great. The highs and mids are so-so: nothing to complain about, but the mids get muddy in certain ranges, and the highs are a tad too sharp at certain tones. I think that these are fine for casual use, but could be lacking for audiophiles.I can definitely say that I've used worse, but there's better earbuds out there.For a pair of earbuds from a such a well-known brand, these miss the mark.

Most importantly, they have excellent sound quality, with the best bass response I've noted in testing several of these types of buds. It boomsThe mid-range and treble range are also well balanced.

They came off without too much issue but getting the new ones on...very tough.They didn't come off easy enough to worry about them popping off during normal wear and use but easy enough that I wasn't worried about tearing them.Pairing them was smooth and they quickly pair and disconnect when taken out and put away.The case is a nice slick black case that fits in the pocket and carges the buds nicely. I only wish there were covers for the case like with the Apple ones so that I can attach them to my lanyard like I do the Apple ones.I use these mainly as my work ear buds while away from the desk and the sound is perfect, I can be heard from other parties loud and clear and the volume on the buds for me works.They feel like they are about to slip out of my ears some times but they don't so i think I'm just used to using the AirPods where they fit inside more. Either that or I need to actually move to a smaller silicone piece.Been using these for some time now and after the initial full charge I haven't had to charge the case yet. I'd say that I've been using them for at least 3 to 4 hours per week and it's been at least three or four weeks since I have charged the case.Overall I'd give them a good rating on almost every aspect. They do cancel out some of the noise but not all of it unless the volume is turned up all the way. They don't crack or hiss when listening to quiet conversations and the little bit that I tested them with music it sounds like they would be perfect listening to everything from Bach to Black Sabbath.Highly recomend.","Reviewed in the United States July 5, 2023",AFDSGC4L4UX5YZCAAVVGRLKTIQUA,0,1,Style: Earbuds with Noise Cancelling,Panasonic ErgoFit True Wireless Earbuds,0.16197638146167556,0.5525846702317292,Neutral

R2RSE6UHEK6L69,B0863H1JKB,1.0 out of 5 stars First ever disappointment with Panasonic,M. Hoffman,1,"I am 73 years of age and have been purchasing Panasonic products since I was in college. Transistor radios, boom boxes, Technics components, telephones, plasma tv (still working more than 10 years old), etc, etc. Most recently I purchased two pairs of Wings bluetooth earbuds. They worked well, BUT their life seemed relatively short. I am still attempting to determine what a reasonable life is for bluetooth earbuds. Now, I purchased these ""true wireless"" (?) earbuds twice. The first pair did not charge. The second pair which I kept has many, many problems with the sensors, maintaining bluetooth connection, etc. When they work, they work well, but it was a full two weeks until the full volume kicked in and that occurred unexpectedly after multiple beeping, changes of volume, cutout, noise setting, etc, etc. Last night was the first time they worked relatively flawlessly until I arrived back home after a two hour walk. They began cutting out again. Considering that I could have bought innumerable cheaper bluetooth earbuds of other manufacturers and far less expensive, it is disappointing. I sincerely hope this is not a continuing problem with Panasonic products. Their customer service is also difficult. As an example, although the directions say you should use ONLY the power cord supplied for charging, the customer service said I could use any generic USB C cord. He had no explanation for the directions. They also fall out of your ears. I am at the end of my rope with these things. Going back. I reset them with the app, explored all attempts to remedy the problems, but they are just too frustrating.","Reviewed in the United States August 4, 2021",AFBMBLTASTCHRQT6H2FUSQGWBM3A,1,9,Color: White,Panasonic True Wireless Earbuds,0.08575268817204301,0.4830645161290322,Neutral

R3O2F0G4RQELXK,B09JL41N9C,5.0 out of 5 stars Movement focused TW earbuds from Beats with great sound,Ant,5,"My pair of Beats Powerbeats Pros were starting to die out on me. I had purchased them secondhand so I wasn’t too upset, but I needed a replacement. I decided to get a new pair of true wireless earbuds this time around.After doing some research on the top recommended workout focused true wireless earbuds, it came down to the Beats Fit Pro and the Beats Studio Buds.Ultimately I decided on the more expensive of the two, thinking it would be worth the extra cost. I got them on a sale that was running here which makes it even better. My use case for them would be for gym workouts such as jogging/walking and lifting, and also for casual use at work and home.I’ve had this pair for a little over 1 year and 6 months. I have purchased Apple care + for them but have not had to use it.EXPERIENCE:The sound on these, personally, is really enjoyable! The noise cancelling and transparency mode work so well.If I’m at the gym and don’t want to hear the other people making noise with their machines or the running of treadmills? Turn on noise cancelling and have music on. In a snap, the outside noises seem to be gone.At work and don’t want to miss a phone call?Turn on transparency mode and you’re free to hear sounds around you. Even better with just one earbud in, too.The mic quality on calls seems to be passable, people seem to hear me fine.*Small note: there is a tiny rip in the silicone/plastic on the right bud’s button near the bottom. I suspect this is from wearing them when going to bed sometimes. I usually wake up and find them out of my ears. There are times where they’re still in my ears, but I tend to move around during when asleep.OTHER THOUGHTS:I really like the wing tips on the earbuds, they stay in my ears perfectly. Sure, there was some soreness in my ears in the beginning, but my ears got used to it pretty fast. Also, the ear tip size helps a lot. Make sure you try all the included sizes to really figure out which one is most comfortable.There is definitely a learning curve on inserting the earbuds into your ears. Once you get the method of inserting them smoothly and creating the right seal, they are more enjoyable. Look at one of the animations in the earbud’s description for reference.Plus, the sage grey colorway just looks dope. Wish there was a lava red colorway available like the Powerbeats Pro.These work great with my iPhone and connected to my PC. Can’t speak for performance on an Android device.

R2LFEEQXQDETXR,B09JL41N9C,4.0 out of 5 stars Good Apple Ecosystem Option for Running,C. Godby,4,"Before buying the Beats Fit Pro, I've owned the PowerBeats Pro and AirPods Pro 2. I'm a runner that wants an Apple ecosystem option that has decent sound quality and won't fall out of my ear. After two runs and a trip to the gym, I'm happy with them so far. Out of the three options above, I consider them the best option for running. My quick thoughts on each:The PowerBeats Pro has been out for two or three years now and I'm surprised there hasn't been an updated model. They're good earbuds for runners...when they work. And the when they work part is infuriating. The earbuds have to line up perfectly with the charging connections in the case or they won't charge. I can't tell you how many times I've gone to use them and found one fully charged and the other dead. There was even a potential class action lawsuit filed against Apple on that (search for it). When they work, the PowerBeats Pro are solid because they hook around your ear. You can have confidence when you run they're not going to fall out - I never had an issue in the two years or so I owned them with that. There is also a physical button for changing songs and pausing the music and a rocker for changing the volume, which is convenient. Cons: sound quality is ho hum in my opinion - it never feels like they secure cleanly in your ear. Also, there's no wireless charging or noise cancellation. Oh, and of course the infuriating charging issues. I would not buy the PowerBeats Pro again for that reason.On to the AirPods Pro 2. These earbuds have better sound quality in my opinion than both the PowerBeats Pro and Beats Fit Pro. The noise cancellation meaningfully improved from gen 1 to gen 2. There's wireless charging and a speaker installed in the case so you can ping them using the ""find my"" app on your iPhone. For day to day use around the home or office, these earbuds are awesome. However, at least for me, they're not for running. While more secure than the regular AirPods, they still fall out of my ears sometimes and that certainly applies to running. If you buy after market rubber hooks, Air Pods Pro 2 (and 1) will stay secure when running and provide a good experience (they don't fall out). That said, having to attach the rubber hooks each time you go to run is a pain in the butt.The Beats Fit Pro makes some compromises, but in my opinion it's the best option for runners based on my limited experience so far. The rubber wing tips ensure that the Beats Fit Pro has a secure fit in your ear. They've felt secure running and haven't fallen out in my experience so far. There's a physical button for changing the song, activating noise cancellation, and pausing the music. Versus the PowerBeats Pro, there's no rubber hook so they're not as secure and there's no volume rocker. However, they do have noise cancellation and fit more snugly in your ear. As a result, I think the sound quality is a little better than the PowerBeats Pro, but not as good as the AirPods Pro 2. On the downside, I think the case feels cheap compared to the AirPods, there's no wireless charging, and there's no speaker on the case for the ""find my"" app. In addition, the case charges using USB C instead of lightning (btw, it's a USB C to USB C cable included with them and there's no power brick included). USB C is coming to iPhone and I believe is already on iPad, but it's irritating that it has a USB C cable instead of lightning when your life revolves around lightning cables.In short, avoid the Powerbeats Pro - the charging issue is a design flaw and will lead to frustration over time. The AirPods Pro 2 are awesome, but they're not a good option for running since they will fall out of many people's ears. The Beats Fit Pro makes compromises, but in my experience so far its the best Apple ecosystem earbud for running.","Reviewed in the United States February 8, 2023",AHYLFTWLZ5YY5FWN3UBI4YSR3ROQ,1,260,Color: Beats BlackStyle: Fit ProSet: Without AppleCare+,Beats Fit Pro (1st Gen),0.3007584485407066,0.5341708023159636,Positive
R35IQTO062Y7LU,B09JL41N9C,5.0 out of 5 stars Best wireless noise cancelling earbuds I have used so far,theInternational,5,"I am a long-time user of the Bose QuietComfort 20 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones. These are my favorite noise cancelling option to use while taking walks. I like to listen to audio books while walking and the QuietComfort 20 are superb for this use. I also like to use a noise cancelling option while listening to audio books and podcasts in the car, especially because my car does not contain road noise well. I decided I would like to have a second QuietComfort 20 reserved for use in my car. An additional advantage to having a second one is if anything happens to the one I walk with, I'll have a backup. But, unfortunately, Bose discontinued the QuietComfort 20 forcing me to have to find another option for use in the car.I first purchased the wireless Bose QuietComfort Earbuds. But I found much to dislike about them. They feel heavy in the ears; the buds themselves just feel heavier and less comfortable than the QuietComfort 20 Headphones. I also disliked that every time I put the Bose QuietComfort Earbuds into my ears they speak to me telling me they are trying to connect to my device and also reporting battery state. I found this incredibly annoying. Another thing I hugely disliked was that there is an uncomfortable ""boom boom"" sensation as I walk with them in. I wear Vibram FiveFinger shoes and do not walk with a heavy gait. I do not get this ""boom boom"" sensation when walking with the QuietComfort 20 headphones. I also disliked how big the Bose QuietComfort Earbuds' case was. I disliked how the Bose QuietComfort Earbuds sometimes felt like they weren't secure in my ears and when I would try to adjust their stability I would accidentally change the noise cancellation setting. On two occasions, an uncomfortable high pitched sound emitted from one of the buds; it only lasted for a couple seconds but it was annoying. I tried using the Bose QuietComfort Earbuds for a month and never could bring myself to like them, so I returned them. I now have a strong dislike for Bose, primarily because they discontinued my beloved QuietComfort 20 Headphones. But up until recently, I was a huge Bose fan.I purchased Apple AirPods Pro. I immediately fell in love with the H1 chip operation. But I didn't like the color white. I also didn't like the stalk that extends down. But I started using them thinking I had found my noise cancelling option for the car. And although the AirPods Pro delivered some ""boom boom"" sensation while walking, it was much much better than the Bose QuietComfort Earbuds. Then I started to become aware of a huge problem with the AirPods Pro. They would not stay in my ears. I would place them in ear, hear the noise cancellation activate and then in time the noise cancellation would turn off because one of the pods had pushed out of my ear enough to cause the noise cancellation function to disengage. I found myself constantly having to push them into my ear in an effort to keep them from pushing out. A couple times they plain fell out of my ears. I consulted instructionals on how to properly insert them into my ears for proper fit. I also did the fit test and passed the test indicating I had good seal. Only the seal wouldn't last and the pods would eventually push out of my ears. So I had to return the AirPods Pro because they wouldn't stay in my ears.I purchased some non noise cancelling earbuds thinking that a passive seal would be enough, but I found a number of problems with this option. I didn't like shoving thing way into my ear. Not only was it a little uncomfortable, but I also wondered about the sanitariness of touching (e.g., foam inserts) prior to shoving them into my ear. Maybe this could lead to ear infection? Also, the amount of sound isolation was too good which diminished my situational awareness while walking and/or driving. So passive noise block earbuds weren't solving my use need.I was worried there was no option for the car and I would not have a backup to my beloved QuietComfort 20 headphones. I really wish I could buy another pair of QuietComfort 20 headphones just to have a backup for the future. After delaying and delaying, I decided to go to the trouble to try one last option for the car: the Beats Fit Pro. Eureka!The Beats Fit Pro are fantastic! They have the H1 chip, which is awesome. They fit and feel way better than the Bose QuietComfort Earbuds and are super secure in my ears, unlike the AirPods Pro. The Beats Fit Pro feel so light to wear. I can wear them all day and there is no discomfort. They also have a button to cycle through the noise cancellation options, which I like a lot better than the tapping that was needed on the Bose QuietComfort Earbuds. I also like the button press on the Beats Fit Pro better than the stalk-squeeze on the AirPods Pro.The one edge that I might say the Bose QuietComfort Earbuds have over the others is the noise cancellation. The Bose QuietComfort Earbuds arguably provide more intense noise cancellation that results in more of a bass presence and a sense that the content being played is closer to you. However, there is a cost to this that I don't think is worth it. The biggest cost for me was the ""boom boom"" sensation while walking. I don't know exactly what is to blame for this but it completely ruins the earbuds for what I want to use them for. I found the fit and noise cancellation of the Beats Fit Pro to be better suited to my needs.I wrote this to help others in their quest to find the earbuds that work best for them. I strongly recommend giving the Beats Fit Pro a try. I like them a lot. I think many others will too.ADDENDUM (added 2022-NOV): My beloved wired Bose QuietComfort 20 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones stopped working a few weeks ago. I purchased the wired Bose Headphones many, many years ago and used them a lot, so it was not unexpected. Fortunately, the Beats Fit Pro have been able to replace the wired Headphones for my daily walks. The Beats Fit Pro have minimal ""boom boom"" sensation while stepping/walking. Although the Beats Fit Pro have more ""boom boom"" than the wired Bose Headphones, the ""boom boom"" is minimal and much, much better than offered by the wireless Bose QuietComfort Earbuds. I have been using the Beats Fit Pro in cold weather lately and discovered that the physical side button on the Beats Fit Pro works fantastically when wearing a hat. For example, if I am wearing a thick knit winter hat, I can still activate the side button on the Beats Fit Pro by pushing on the outside of the hat. This can't be done with a touch-operation ""button"" like found on the Bose QuietComfort Earbuds. The AirPods Pro ""button"" might be more difficult to operate with a hat on too. So if you are intending to use earbuds under a hat or hood, Beats Fit Pro will give you the advantage of still having full, easy use of the side button for play/pause operation from outside the hat.","Reviewed in the United States July 13, 2022",AHJD4656VLR6I3TCW544TITKJBUQ,1,769,Color: Sage GrayStyle: Fit ProSet: Without AppleCare+,Beats Fit Pro (1st Gen),0.19060282953761204,0.5164106280193236,Neutral

They’d fall out chewing while eating lunch. They’d fall out while going for a run or exercising. AirPods just do not fit me at all.This year I’ve been running a lot more and it was the final straw. I needed ear buds that would actually stay in my ears so I could focus on my workout. That’s when I took the leap and bought the Beats Fit Pros.They fit my ear perfectly. I’d say my ears are on the larger side because these ear buds sit in my without any discomfort. There was no break in period at all. They feel just right. If you have medium to large ears and are looking for ear buds to workout in, these are the ones.The sound quality, and built in Beats equalizer curve could certainly be better. That has been remedied by adjusting the equalizer in Spotify. I found the Acoustic and Lounge presets to sound the best.","Reviewed in the United States July 23, 2024",AHIFPJD5HEAYZFSW7JVKZUA3WYAQ,1,0,Color: Beats WhiteStyle: Fit ProSet: Without AppleCare+,Beats Fit Pro (1st Gen),0.31555555555555553,0.4687301587301588,Positive
REDXSAP527XVD,B09JL41N9C,5.0 out of 5 stars Compared to 4 other Earbuds...,Connor,5,"I bought these earbuds along with 4 other pairs, with the intent of comparing them over a couple weeks and returning all but my favorite. Here were the results:Beats Fit Pro - https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09JL65GNM?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_detailsPros – These buds had some great base, and the wingtip gave them a fit that made them refuse to fall out of my ears. But the best feature? Physical “clicky” buttons on each one of the buds. You press in and hear/feel the click, rather than relying on a touchscreen-like feature. No need to guess if you tapped them once or twice, you will know.Cons – The wingtip gives a very sturdy fit, but not the most comfortable. I wouldn’t recommend to anyone with smaller ears. The noise canceling was solid, but nothing special. And this may be picky, but I didn’t care for most of the color schemes available. I prefer my earbuds to be hard to notice, and even the black ones have a bright red letter “b” in the middle.Beats Studio Buds - https://www.amazon.com/dp/B096SV8SJG?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_detailsPros – Very comfortable with the same great physically “clicky” buttons as the Beats Fit Pro. Noise canceling seemed slightly better than average. Great base. Classic look.Cons – Tested during a workout, a little bit of sweat had these sliding right out of my ear. The case for these earbuds also was the flimsiest of any I had tested, with a very weak hinge that I was scared of breaking off within the 2 weeks of using.Samsung Galaxy Buds Pro - https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08MWZHHKP?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_detailsPros – A neat feature that I noticed only in these earbuds was that it had noise amplification as well as noise cancelation. With one swipe in the app, the surrounding sound was actually louder and clearer than it would be without the earbuds in. Great if you are hard of hearing, or just enjoy snooping on conversations out of reach.Cons – Similar to the Beats Studio Buds, these didn’t stay in during a workout. They were usable, but every 10 minutes I found myself pushing them back into my ear. And this is an opinion, but these are the ugliest earbuds out of the bunch. The shiny black gleam made it look like a large beetle was hanging out in my ear. No visible brand placement either, which makes them appear cheap and generic rather than the quality Samsung they are.Samsung Galaxy Buds Live - https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09TBM1L3S?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_detailsPros – Cost effective! I added these to the test group because of the unique shape, and for that they are worth giving a try. If you have small ears and do not like the rubber insert that is standard in most other earbuds, these may be perfect for you.Cons – Poor fit for large ears. These were tested the least of all of the buds, because the fit was so bad for my ear shape that they wouldn’t stay in if I turned my head too fast.Bose QuietComfort - https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08C4KWM9T?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_detailsPros – Bose noise canceling is unmatched. If your primary use for earbuds is to cancel out that background white noise, this is the pair for you. The sound quality is great, not too heavy on the base. The case for the earbuds stood out from the rest as the only one that impressed me. Felt very study, and I had no worries tossing it into a gym bag or cup holder. The only case with a button latch to make sure it doesn’t open accidentally.Cons – This was the most expensive pair of earbuds by a longshot, and there were still some things I felt could be improved. The rubber inserts had more of a “flayed” shape rather than the “rounded” shape that is standard. My guess is that this was by design, because the earbuds were also slightly heavier than others and may need that extra in-ear grip. The flayed shape did make them sturdier, but at the cost of them being uncomfortable in an active situation. They were also the largest earbuds, and stuck out from the side of my head further than I would have liked.My favorite? The beats fit pro! While I wouldn’t recommend this pair for everyone, it was perfect for my routine. My music taste benefits from the boosted base, and the wingtip shape was perfect for any workouts. The feature that really convinced me was the physical buttons, something that I didn’t realize how desperately I needed.","Reviewed in the United States August 11, 2022",AFEITP6Y25NKH3KB2LXWQCC7STIA,1,486,Color: Sage GrayStyle: Fit ProSet: Without AppleCare+,Beats Fit Pro (1st Gen),0.16530880230880232,0.5307694003527337,Neutral
R28ZWVS937ZQTG,B09JL41N9C,4.0 out of 5 stars Not the most comfortable,Theo,4,"The **Beats Fit Pro** is a versatile pair of true wireless earbuds that caters to both Android and iPhone users. Let's dive into the details:1. **Audio Quality (5/5):** The standout feature of the **Fit Pro** is its impressive sound quality. The bass is punchy, mids are clear, and highs are well-defined. Whether you're at the gym or in the office, the audio experience is top-notch.2. **Comfort and Fit (4/5):** The earbuds come with an intuitive ear tip fit test, ensuring a snug fit. However, some users may find the wing tips a bit uncomfortable during extended wear. If you're okay with shorter sessions, the comfort level is decent.3. **Noise Cancellation (4/5):** The active noise cancellation (ANC) works effectively, blocking out ambient noise. It's not on par with premium ANC headphones, but it gets the job done.4. **Design and Build (4/5):** The Fit Pro's rounded housings and tapered wing tips give them a unique look. The case is compact and easy to carry. However, the chunky earpieces might not appeal to everyone.5. **Price (3/5):** Here's where the Fit Pro falls short. At $199.99 USD, they're on the pricey side. If they were a tad more affordable, they'd easily earn that fifth star.In summary, the **Beats Fit Pro** delivers excellent audio quality and comfort, but the price tag holds it back from perfection.

R3OU5G5RXBTK3T,B09JL41N9C,"5.0 out of 5 stars Finally, Something By Beats I Can Endorse",Jeff Gomske,5,"I work in radio. I've done it for 30+ years and one of the curses/blessings of working with audio is I have grown to understand intimately what really good audio sounds like. I have used countless number of headphones and earbuds (and there 𝙄𝙎 a difference between the two) and there are a few names which stand above the rest, and I'm not going to get into a debate because so-called, 'Audiophiles' will claim they know better (Which begs the question, how does one actually 𝙗𝙚𝙘𝙤𝙢𝙚 an Audiophile in the first place? Is there a course you can take, or does one simply give themselves that title? But I digress...) when Beats first hit the scene, they were unquestionably an astonishing waste of money. Their audio quality was maybe a shade above average at best. But, that didn't stop millions of people from buying them at outrageous prices. Well, the uncontested King of over-priced products (apple) got wind of this and did a takeover of their products and an interesting thing happened: their quality got BETTER.Did they become as good as most ""professional"" headphones out there...? Probably not. However, their earbuds did become notably better. I feel it necessary to point out that while Beats headphones were nowhere as good as many claimed, their earbuds from the beginning seemed to be pretty good from the get-go. Their unique ""hook"" style which wrapped around your ear for a secure fit (you either love this style or not - but you cannot argue that they did not fit and stay in place better than almost any other brand out there). Some of their other wired earbuds were still decent as well, if not priced at the upper end of what most people were willing to pay, but at least the earbuds could be counted on to give you an above average experience.Apple buys them out and reorganizes the entire company. Suddenly they are no longer all over the place like they used to be. Famous people were no longer wearing them everywhere you looked. Then apple releases their Beats branded earbuds, the Powerbeats Pro. Love them or hate them, they made an impact.They were also equipped with apple tech like their H1 chip which made them instantly compatible with iPhones (a pretty smart move, actually) and the audio was excellent, especially for working out. Then they release the Beats Fit Pro.A radically different design. But - a welcome one, especially for someone who loved the Powerbeats great audio quality, but not the hook design. Again, it's hard to please everyone when it comes to something that fits inside your ears that have so many different possible sizes and an almost infinite number of differences from one person to the next...like the apple airpods, one size fit 𝙢𝙤𝙨𝙩...and if you were one of the people they did not fit, well you were kind of SOL. At least with the Fit Pro they opened up better fitting to a much larger segment than the airpods and with the included wing-tip design, they immediately caught the eye of many athletes who need earbuds which stay put while sometimes being fairly aggressive in their workouts. If you were not a fan of the Powerbeats hook style, the Fit Pro's must have looked like a gift from On High.FIrst off, they really DO sound great. Good bass without going too deep. Music NEEDS good bass, but if it thumps too hard, it will ruin audio in more ways than I can describe here. Mids and Highs were also both pretty crisp and not overly isolated. The blend just works. Whoever tuned the Fit Pro should be commended for doing such a great job.ANC was...disappointing. To be fair, to get great ANC into such a tiny device really IS a challenge and oftentimes going all-in on this feature usually means you sacrifice audio quality. In this case, Beats chose to put more into the audio than into the ANC. I had a difficult time even recognizing that it was even turned on at all. Maybe my pair simply isn't doing it's job. However, the OnePlus buds Z2 has ANC that is actually pretty good and still has really impressive audio as well, so I'm not exactly sure why the Fit Pro's is so difficult to even tell if ANC is on or off, but I can only review what I have and that seems to be the case with my particular pair.The wing-tip design really works well - for me at least. They provide a pretty good fit and they stay put incredibly well. My biggest problem with earbuds is exactly that. Either they'll fit well, or almost not at all. It doesn't seem to fall anywhere in between. My OnePlus buds Z2 sound great, but I constantly find myself adjusting them in my ears - which honestly is annoying. The Fit Pro's (at least in my case) I set them in, twist to secure the wing-tip and they just stay put. This is going to be subjective since everyone is slightly different, so keep in mind my experience with how they fit in my ear may not mirror your own.You can do a little customizing with the app. I do have an iPhone but I primarily use an android, so I downloaded the app and you can to a bit of customizing, however, not as much as I would have liked to have seen given what these earbuds are capable of. I believe the iPhone integration has quite a bit more options than the android counterpart. This seems to be more the norm these days as apple and Samsung work hard to reward you for buying products that are more in line with their products than the competition. I wish they'd both put an end to this childish bickering and open up all their products that can be used on other platforms to include all the options that they would have if you paired it with an iPhone or a Samsung. Either you want your customers to get the best bang for their buck or not.I like the physical buttons the Fit Pro uses. You'll know by touch that you've pressed it instead of simply the ""touch"" controls which in my experience can be hit or miss. When they work great, it's awesome. But do they all work perfectly every time? Of course not. With buttons, they seem to work pretty much 100% of the time and that's something I appreciate.No wireless charging. At this point, especially for the cost, that really is something they should have included. Is it a deal breaker? For some it very well could be. It wasn't for me, but I love wireless charging and think every pair of wireless earbuds over $100 really ought to include it. I know earbuds that cost under $40 that do, so to not include it here seems to be almost an insult. They use USB-C charging which IS convenient however. Beats claims they have fast charging however, in fact they call it ""Fast Fuel"" where just 5 minutes of charging will net you an hour of listening...I haven't been able to check this, but I CAN state that they do seem to charge pretty quick, so that may negate some of the disappointment of not having wireless ability, but necessarily so.The case is pretty nice, too. It is quite a bit smaller than the case for the Powerbeats, but still larger than what you get with the airpods. I honestly didn't mind the size at all, so this one is also going to be pretty subjective.For the most part, these are the first apple made earbuds that I can recommend even if you own an android device. The audio is stellar and they seem to hold a charge for about an average length of time for earbuds of this size. I rarely listen for more than about an hour, maybe 2 at the most, so I'm not the guy to look for with advice on listening at length (unless it's for headphones, then I can make a LOT of recommendations). Honestly, I'm happy with mine. Are they perfect? No. But are they worth it? I sure think so.***UPDATE***I purchased some memory foam eartips...not sure that this was a wise decision. Not because they don't work or fit well, but because they are slightly larger, it means fitting them back into the charging case either they won't charge or they'll be problematic to fit properly. Now, in all fairness, this wasn't an issue with the smallest foam eartips, but the medium and larger ones did not like to fit back into the case. They also did not really make any noticeable difference is audio quality, so I switched back to the original tips they came with. Lesson learned.","Reviewed in the United States March 22, 2023",AHJED44JHCW4ATDA2K2MQRWPZQ7A,1,558,Color: Volt YellowStyle: Fit ProSet: Without AppleCare+,Beats Fit Pro (1st Gen),0.25156926406926405,0.557703081232493,Positive
R14J76DRBT8EHE,B09JL41N9C,"4.0 out of 5 stars Wonderful sound quality, great features, but missing one important feature",J. Sierra,4,"I'll start by stating that I appreciate and recognize great quality audio, and certainly prefer the highest quality audio that I can reasonably get when I'm listening to headphones and/or earbuds. That being said, the important word here is ""reasonably"", and I don't have tremendous expectations from earbuds that are also intended for working out, etc. it's just not reasonable to expect to compare them to over-ear headphones, in terms of quality or features. Noise cancellation, bass response, highs, mids.... Over-ear are always going to edge out earbuds. There's just more space to make it all work.Ok that's out of the way. I didn't have huge expectations and I wasn't even convinced that the buds would be worth the $150 (they were on sale when I bought them.) I'm not convinced *any* ear bud is worth more than $100, and I've tried some very ""high-end"" units.So I pulled the trigger with some hesitation, received them, charged them up, paired em to my phone after downloading the proprietary Beats app (didn't like that, but there's good news), popped em in (after trying the different sized ends) and went on a run (because I feel like that constant bouncing is the likeliest to cause them to fall out.)I was.... Extremely surprised. Surprised and a little impressed. Sound quality is actually really, really good... Far better than I would've expected from a Beats product, more akin to the high quality Sony and Technics units. There are two ""modes"", sound-cancelling and transparency mode (transparency mode allows for awareness of what's going on around you by almost enhancing ambient noise.) Noise cancellation is surprisingly good, though yes, okay, not the absolute best I've heard but it's in the top 3 for ear buds, no question. It's effective, even if it eats battery up like crazy. I appreciate transparency mode though - especially while running or biking. It's not disturbing to have the ambient noise available and there's a safety component there that can't be overstated. And it works really well.Pairing them up was a little... Interesting. They're clearly designed by and for Apple people, so if you're rocking that Apple tech the process is probably mostly automated (that's as advertised) but with Android you theoretically have you use a Beats app. At first that aggravated me (I really hate proprietary apps) but then the pairing failed and I discovered that I could indeed pair via Bluetooth, it's super fast and easy, and the Beats app just gives me a handy place to activate some features/controls. I can't speak to the Apple experience though.Charging is where I was actually disappointed enough to take a star off the product. The case is ok, has cool little magnets to keep the buds in place, but it only works as a charging station when plugged in. No wireless charging. That's a huge miss for Beats. Huge. There are a ton of comparable products at that price profile and all of them offer wireless charging. It's maybe not a deal breaker and they do have ok battery life but it's... Extremely disappointing. Battery life is going to depend a lot on whether you use noise cancellation or not. Kind of a big fluctuation there, ymmv, maybe not the best but definitely far from the worst. They certainly last well beyond exercise sessions, and are capable of giving most of your day music. Again though, lack of wireless charging is blatantly, conspicuously missing. And it's annoying because if it had wireless charging the battery life would almost become inconsequential. Fortunately, thanks to Amazon, there are actually aftermarket cases that do have wireless charging, giving you approximately three days worth of charge. It's an extra thirty bucks so it's something you'll want to keep in mind/consider as part of ownership. Don't get me wrong, it's not a deal breaker - there's plenty of battery life - but it's one of those things that premium buds should have. Period. And these are supposed to be premium buds.The fit is exceptionally comfortable. There are several tips that help with sealing but also support the stability in the ear while doing exercise. After a run/jog session they stayed in without any issues. Even with plenty of sweat, they were good to go. The extra little fin protrusion also contributed effectively to it staying in and in place. I would have been more surprised at this but I've been using ear bud hearing protection recently and they're so light and well fitting that I know what good buds are capable of in this particular domain.The features are actually pretty neat, but mostly expected, like swapping automatically from buds to phone and back again, going single-bud with nary a hiccup, and plenty more. They're pretty slick in functionality. The buttons are also tactile, providing a neat click; seems like a little thing but from an interface perspective it's a surprisingly big deal, and it works really well.So, are they good? I think that they're overpriced but I think all ear buds these days are so, grain of salt. I think they're very very good buds, they exceeded my admittedly mid expectations, they function flawlessly and most importantly: they deliver great sound. Would I buy them for two bills? Eh.... Knowing what I know now about them and how good they are, that goes from a hard no to a soft maybe. At $150ish I think they're a decent value. Are they better than over ear options? Not in terms of sheer quality no, but: they're a million times better for exercise and working out. Unless you like being one of those douchey gym rats with the Beats over-ear. Then I can't help you.For the rest of us, these are a very fine choice. Sony and Technics have offerings that actually do have intensely high quality audio, but these come close enough in terms of audio and they're good for a sweaty, bouncy, jouncy session of your favorite exercise, whatever that might be.As always, ymmv. But hey, with Amazon if you don't like em, you can just return them. Hopefully my review helped a little.Merry Christmas!","Reviewed in the United States December 26, 2023",AHG4U7VZCV63NJNZUKLWXRXUFIKQ,1,25,Color: Sage GrayStyle: Fit ProSet: Without AppleCare+,Beats Fit Pro (1st Gen),0.21150503290747186,0.5578435927216415,Positive
R33EWBK9B5WOQ6,B09JL41N9C,5.0 out of 5 stars My New Daily Driver,Dylan Geuss,5,"I really like these a lot, I got them through Amazon Resale for a much cheaper price, however they were still basically brand new, so I feel like I lucked out on these puppies! For the longest time I've struggled with finding earbuds that are able to stay in my ear without the fear of feeling them slowly slipping out overtime, thanks to the amazing wingtips! Every other earbuds I have bought and used over the years did not have wingtips, and as a result, due to the shape of my ears, they would eventually fall out after doing so much as just walking with them in.I'm not audiophile, but these sound great, very comparable to my Pixel Buds Pro in terms of quality, albeit with less options for tuning the sound to your tastes, but that's not something I concern myself too much with anyway, since for me personally, I don't need many options other than just wanting them to work and sound good out of the box. There's plenty of bass, but it's not so much that it overwhelms everything else about the sound, when listening to music anyway.These were able to pair to my phone pretty easily once I downloaded the Beats app from the Play Store, and setup is about as simple as it gets! Open the case, tap the sync button, and boom, you're off to the races! Bluetooth is very stable from the time I've used them so far, no random disconnects or audio garbling as far as I can tell.These come with their own USB-C cable for charging, and it's just like any other earbuds that charge the same way, and although the lack of wireless charging is apparent, it was never something I used much anyway, so for me, I'm fine with plugging these in when the juice gets low. In terms of how far these reach while in use, they seem to have a range of about 30 feet or so, I was able to walk around my apartment while using them and they had no issues staying connected.Overall, these are a great pair, definitely consider picking them up for yourself if you've had issues with more typical earbuds staying secure in your ears. I got a much better deal on these than the standard price, but even still, I think these are worth every dollar.","Reviewed in the United States July 26, 2024",AGMVDVBKAEDITJJDXFU7WCH4TSUQ,1,0,Color: Sage GrayStyle: Fit ProSet: Without AppleCare+,Beats Fit Pro (1st Gen),0.23074242424242428,0.4612337662337664,Positive

Not gonna lie, huge difference in quality.Wasn't expecting it to be that different.But, alas, it is.Now with that said, these are not as affordable as the Studio Buds as I said previously..The fits, not on sale and on sale, not for a budget audio seeker, unless needing them to stay in, is a must. Then save up for the fits or go with another cheaper brand.So think about what is important as far as staying in your ears.If you're looking for a chill around the house, sure the Beats Studio Pros are excellent.If you wanna run, clean your yard...don't get the Studio Beats BudsSave and get the Beats Fit Pros.We shall see what's up with the 4.5 not 6 hours of play time ....

R1PTVZ5IJ2ZL6,B09JL41N9C,4.0 out of 5 stars Good for Apple ecosystem - not fully convinced at price point,decadeindc,4,"UPDATE 17 Feb 2024: Had to buy another pair after 13 months. The takeaway is: clean your earbuds thoroughly every 3-4 weeks with a earbud cleaning tool. There is a small screen on the little earbud sound exit point that’s visible when the ear tip is removed. That screen came entirely off on one earbud and the other earbud was partially blocked from impacted ear wax that had hardened so much that it fused to the screen (which is fragile and not attached to the housing with much glue). I cleaned the silicone tips regularly, but never cleaned those small openings and screens, much to my peril. (And yes, I clean my ears daily.) The earbuds still technically work ok, but without those screens in place, it’s only a matter of time before additional ear wax begins to change the sound and eventually corrode or block the drivers.Otherwise, my year-plus of experience with these earbuds was great. I used them for a minimum of an hour every day, and often much longer. They fit comfortably, produce great sound, hold good battery life, easily connect to all my Apple devices. I misjudged the battery life in my original review. Transparency mode is fine and noise canceling is good, although I’m not sure the trade off with battery life from “normal” mode is always worth it. The trade off of wired USB-C charging and no wireless charging is something I can live with. Don’t think any earbud is comfortable enough to wear all day on conference calls, but certainly around four hours is fine. I’ve experienced more than a few instances where the sound stops playing via my iPhone randomly and it looks like the Bluetooth connection has severed. I can’t just press on the left earbud to start playing again, I have to physically press play on my iPhone app and magically the earbuds start working again. Hard to tell what the problem is, but it happens once a week or so. Still think the price/value ratio is about as good as any other wireless earbud, especially in the Apple ecosystem, including AirPods.Original review … Pros: comfy for in-ear buds, especially for physical activity, works really nicely with Apple’s ecosystem including spatial audio, noise cancellation is very good as is transparency mode, sound quality is decent, can use one bud at a time if desired, USB-C charging. Cons: no multipoint connectivity, no wireless charging, water resistance rating lower than many other earbuds, battery life is barely adequate (both buds and charging case), outgoing audio voice quality is also just adequate.These are good earbuds, no question. But there are some maddening features skipped here that appear on much less expensive Bluetooth products. I still don’t understand why Apple’s Bluetooth audio products don’t include multipoint connectivity, even within their own ecosystem. My ancient Plantronics ear piece and my Bose headphones have had multipoint for years, and lack of it is really annoying when using the Beats for work purposes. Lack of wireless charging is less a concern for me, but is annoying at this price point if you’ve invested in the technology. The outgoing voice quality is probably fine for the form factor of the Beats, but it does sound like a telephone call when using Teams or Zoom rather than high quality audio. Biggest bug for me is these won’t make it through a full eight hour day of calls without a recharge, and the case only holds enough charge for 35 hours of use. I have a pair of Anker Life Dot 2s that are 5.5x less expensive with a 100 hour case that isn’t really any bigger. I realize many other buds won’t hit that eight hour mark either, so maybe it’s a complaint about the form factor.The sound quality is fine considering the Bluetooth codec used by Apple (either source or headphone) isn’t high def or even CD quality, despite what Apple might want you to think with the inclusion of spatial audio capability on the Beats. The drivers on the Beats are certainly acceptable for most users and given the mission and price point of the Beats, it’s about as good as anybody should expect. There’s room for improvement, but not much more without moving up in price or a change in codec use by Apple.One thing I did expect was a better water resistance rating. IPX4 is a little weak considering iPhones are at IP67.What I do really like is the noise cancellation (and transparency mode done well) of the Beats. Really works well. The earbuds are very comfortable to wear and get a good seal. The ear wings hold the earbuds in the ear without turning uncomfortable. Love the Apple ecosystem integration - these connect very easily with simple adjustments to iPhone and MacBook Pro alike.If you like the idea of AirPods Pro that fit better and stay in your ear more securely, you’ll probably like these. Again, for the price, these seem to hit most marks for what they are, which is a sort of Jack-of-all-trades Bluetooth earbud. Be sure to shop around if you value one specific element over another, like audio quality or battery life.","Reviewed in the United States January 8, 2023",AH553ARDDAOXIY2C5AOXI34LGJQA,1,53,Color: Sage GrayStyle: Fit ProSet: Without AppleCare+,Beats Fit Pro (1st Gen),0.19370129870129865,0.5182732225039918,Neutral
RCBPKVDSLY4O2,B09JL41N9C,5.0 out of 5 stars Great Earbuds,AJ Harris,5,"Great earbuds. Only thing is I had to get them serviced, by Apple, not even a month in because of some defection that caused them to randomly screech then one went out. Took about a 3-4 week turnaround for Apple to send them off, because they don't have the parts and analysis tools in store to test them. The repair took a hot second because they had to order a part for it but all in all, with Apple Care, you're taken care of. Since I got them back, they have been great. They can fit to any ear and will not fall out because of the holder that keeps it attached to your ear. Noise cancelling is great, and quality is definitely there. If you're in the market for some good earbuds for everything, including working out, these are for you, if you don't mind spending a little bit more.The charging is case is a tad bulky bit it's cool at the same time.","Reviewed in the United States July 19, 2024",AHVDWMAGSYK7TILBU63O7PEMN24A,1,0,Color: Tidal BlueStyle: Fit ProSet: Without AppleCare+,Beats Fit Pro (1st Gen),0.24375,0.5267857142857143,Positive
RCUUN4FL47CDU,B09JL41N9C,4.0 out of 5 stars Positives/Negatives,CR,4,"I purchased Beats Pro for a couple of reasons: First, I felt they would provide a more secure fit than my AirPod pros. Second, they promised seamless compatibility with Apple products. The device has fulfilled both of these conditions. Additionally, Beats offers ample battery life and reasonably good sound quality (I don’t listen to music very much, so the sound assessment is based upon podcasts and audio books and seminars).Now some negatives: First, the noise cancellation is notably less robust than the AirPods Pro. This deficiency combined with the volume limits of the Beats renders them far less useable in noisier environments such as outdoors near traffic and in airports. Second, the case is significant larger than the AirPod’s. With the size, and the smooth roundness, as well as the clamshell opening, I find I drop the case frequently. The smaller AirPod’s case and the different way it opens, have made for more secure handling in the two or three years I’ve owned the AirPods.","Reviewed in the United States July 17, 2024",AGRVHRQ24NRJJWBYKGAJMBE7KFCA,1,1,Color: Beats WhiteStyle: Fit ProSet: Without AppleCare+,Beats Fit Pro (1st Gen),0.20775641025641028,0.3975,Positive
R1ALB57R90GVZ0,B09JL41N9C,2.0 out of 5 stars Unimpressive,Sean,2,"So, I don't know what to think about tech reviewers these days... they all seem to be sponsored now.I got the Beats Pro Fit due to high reviews on sites by critics, rather than just individual input.I have small ears that I frequently have everything pop out when mowing, etc. Pretty much only the Air Pods sit comfortably, or a Sony in ear monitor from 15 years ago. I wanted to try these out for their wingtips to keep them in and, well, extremely let down in every way.2 stars for sound quality. They sound tinny and low quality, like I bought 15 dollar buds at a gas station when I listen to podcasts and youtube. Any standard speech. I did not try them with movies, but music was also a letdown. They were FAR worse than my Jbird Vistas in every way on sound quality. By far, these Beats Pro Fit are the worse audio quality of any bud I have tried in 15 years over the 50 dollar price point and these are 200. Absolutely terrible for audiophiles.I kinda laughed when my dad said friends don't let friends buy beats, they are just so bad.The music STARTED to approach something rich, but it was interfered too much with its attempt to be sound silencing. It seemed like there were supposed to be settings adjusted to bring out a rich sound experience, but the controls just weren't there and its automatic settings, terrible. I don't know if they are simply low quality like others have stated, or cannot live up to their potential with the software control suite.It was the software control suite that people hate with Sony and Bose that prevented me from buying them instead...1 star comfort. If I wear these for an hour everything about the experience is unpleasant. They are also the singularly least comfortable buds I have ever worn. They feel cheap and hard. The sound silencing pushes too hard into my ear instead of creating a seal. All in all, headaches and ear aches after very little time on these. I have never experienced ear fatigue this fast before.3 stars fit. The wingtips seem to work, they aren't great and push the bud into an awkward angle causing more fatigue. But at least I didn't have to re-adjust when mowing the lawn, even if 1 felt a little loose. They aren't truly secure for my ear shape, which is small and shallow. But the wingtip did keep them in. I don't know that I would trust running, jumping jacks, going upside down in these, anything raucus, although that is their purpose.4 star connectivity. Potentially 5 star controls. Connectivity has been superior to my Sony WH 1000XM4, WAY better than my attempt with the Seinheisser bluetooth headphones I had to replace last year with the WH 1000XM4s. The controls are superior to any other bluetooth I have had over the years. Definitely their best draw is their controls and connectivity/digital stability.I just absolutely would not get them if audio quality is your first, comfort your second. Sound silencing is not important to me nor desired as it almost always compromises comfort and quality. I don't know why we have an obsession with pushing all sound out with IEMs when headphones are more prime for that. We need a good seal, a comfortable seat, and high quality drivers. Not a sound silencing air push into our ear drums to try to override our sense of external sounds.The most comfortable listening experience to date were some open back Seinheisser wired headphones. A good quality listen, not the best, but exceedingly comfortable for endless listening and not feeling totally isolated and cut off from surroundings (I don't like not knowing what is going on around me, it makes me uncomfortable, I don't need a sensory deprivation music session in public places, I'll do that in my room to recharge).Overall I give this product a 2.5 stars due to outstanding controls and connectivity. Although I will post as 2 stars as those weight FAR less than quality and comfort for me personally.","Reviewed in the United States July 29, 2024",AFBXBLF7WBIYIUHMMQWDRF2WUFFQ,1,0,Color: Sage GrayStyle: Fit ProSet: Without AppleCare+,Beats Fit Pro (1st Gen),0.09920829016662353,0.5588186134852801,Neutral
R10AOMN7EKJ0R0,B09JL41N9C,4.0 out of 5 stars Slightly shy of perfection,VrunaS,4,"I have been using these for two days but tested the features extensible during that time so I thought I would share my thoughts if they help anyone.I wanted a pair of good earbuds for working out as well as extensive daily use- I listen to quite a bit of music as well as podcasts while I work. I have used Bose Soundsport wireless earbuds as my go to earbuds for the past 5 years and they finally are starting to reach the end of their life. Hence I decided that this prime day would be a good day to treat my ears to something nice.Overall I love these beats fit pro. They are super comfortable as other reviewers have pointed out to the point that if I wasn’t listening to anything on the earbuds I would possibly forget they were in my ears. Even though I loved them I wasn’t convinced they were worth the price until later today when I tried earbuds that were half the price and I hated them.As far as the features go here is what I feel-PROS:1. Super comfortable!! They might as well be the most comfortable earbuds I have ever used. What is surprising is the all the tips fit my ears well and feel comfortable. Even the largest tips that came with the earbud are super comfortable and don’t feel like they are stretching my ear canal- which is something I have never experienced before.2. Super secure in the ears- the wingtips hold them snug in the ear. They don’t budge even with the most intense activity. The earbuds are super low profile against the ears and not bulky or heavy at all. This enhances their comfort even more.3. Great music quality- I tested sounds from different genres and the songs that are suppose to be bass heavy (Get Lucky by Daft Punk for eg) do have a very nice skull shaking bass but in a very good way and without sacrificing the highs and mediums. Just as a point of reference (and because great quality can be a very subjective description)- the audio quality is very comparable to the one with the Bose Soundsport wireless earphones- the bass is just a hair better though.4. Earbuds appear in “Find My”- I love that I can potentially track where my earbuds are if I every lost them as long as they have a charge. They can also play a sound using the “find my” app to help you locate them. As a person who is constantly forgetting where I put things once I am home, this is going to serve me really well!5. Love having Siri compatible with the buds- Siri reading out my messages to me the past two days has been pretty fun and useful- Siri does interrupt your audio content jot announce messages (which my Bose never did) but this also means I won’t miss urgent texts while I am at work and not staring at my phone.CONS:1. ANC: it’s not absolute or the best out there although not a very critical point for me. I jump scare easily and so having something that completely cancels all background noise is not something I desire. I mean honestly for me the ANC is good enough- it completely gets rids of all low hums and mechanical noises— I was sitting next to my loud AC and with the ANC on it was whisper quiet. But I could still hear my husband speaking when he was near me and I could still hear the songs they were playing the gym if my own music was on a lower volume. So it doesn’t completely drown out all noise if that’s what you need. Again while the ANC for these is adequate for me- the only reason I put it as a con is because at this price point and considering ANC seems to be one of their major selling points I would have thought it would be better.2. Spatial Audio- this feature just seems like a waste for me. Although it’s personal preference I guess. With this feature it seems like the sound is coming from a specific point a few inches from my face- as if I were attending a live concert and inches away from the performer/band- and if I turn my head it does seem to track pretty well in that sense. However when I listen to music I would like it to be a completely immersive experience as if the sound is coming from inside my head not a fixed point out of my body. So for me I think it’s a pretty useless setting- at least for me.3. The case seems to be open easily in a bag or purse. The magnets holding the case closed are weaker than expected. Although I am not worried about the earphones automatically falling out of the case even if the case opens. The attachment of the earbuds to the case is very strong.","Reviewed in the United States July 15, 2023",AGEAS25333CRQMSXOQ6ZP2UJXGTQ,1,179,Color: Stone PurpleStyle: Fit ProSet: Without AppleCare+,Beats Fit Pro (1st Gen),0.19258194186765618,0.534383176347462,Neutral

The fit is more secure in the ears and better for exercise, but it might take you a little while to get used to them. At first, it feels like they're not all the way in, but still, the fit is secure, and I have never had a problem with them falling out.

R3BJQEGT2UE1HS,B09JL41N9C,4.0 out of 5 stars Better than Apple AirPod Pro,P.S.,4,"After my Apple AirPods stopped working, I was looking for a replacement and found these. Since they work with the Apple ecosystem, I figured I’d give them a shot. I bought them on sale and was floored by the noise cancellation and comfort. I hated the AirPods how they’d move if knocked around a little bit. A year later the Beats battery life shortened and one ear bud would not charge as fast as the other so I threw them away and bought a new pair. It’s now been a year later with the new set and they’re doing the same thing. It frustrates me because I love these, but they seem to be only good for a year.I decided to buy a pair of Apple AirPod Pros in hopes that maybe they’d be the new replacement. I didn’t like the odd fit they have, but thought I’d live with it if they were better, but the sound quality was so tinny compared to the Beats that I returned them the next day. Maybe it was a bad pair of AirPod Pros, but I couldn’t believe the difference in sound quality. I’ll gives these another month and buy them again, but with Apple Care so they can be replaced after they stop charging properly.These are great earbuds, but only if you get Apple Care and know you’ll have to replace them every year.","Reviewed in the United States June 18, 2024",AG7G3DOT5A47QVQHQS7DF33SBI2A,1,0,Color: Beats WhiteStyle: Fit ProSet: Without AppleCare+,Beats Fit Pro (1st Gen),0.10288208168642951,0.4665349143610013,Neutral
R38UJJJXRBSZ9H,B09JL41N9C,"4.0 out of 5 stars Good sound, secure fit",Sherry Young,4,"I bought these buds to replace my (1st gen) Powerbeats Pros. What I was looking for in an upgrade was better sound, better fit, and sound cancellation. The Beats Fit Pros largely delivered.I had the Powerbeats for almost 4 years, and they were fine. The sound was okay. The fit was secure, and comfortable on their own but not when wearing glasses. They were a little hard to put on, and they had a tendency for one of the buds to fail to charge that drove me crazy. So - the price reduction on the Beats Fit Pros convinced me that it was time to try something else.The Beats Fit Pros are easy to put in my ears, and plenty secure for everything I do. I have no trouble with either my long hair nor my glasses. They snap into the charging case and seem to solve the failure to charge problem.Sound and software featuresThey paired with my Apple devices flawlessly. The ear fit test was easy and helpful. Right out of the box, the sound was much like the Powerbeats. But running the quick ear scan for the adaptive eq and enabling spatial audio, set to fixed, made a huge difference. Highs sparkle, mids are clear and well separated, and it really gives a sense of soundstage that is hard to describe. Definitely keeping these.Sound CancellationI really don't have anything to compare the degree of sound cancellation to. The Powerbeats didn't have any, and my last attempt was with the original implementation by Bose, which really did not work for me. I heard a distinct buzz or hiss that degraded sound quality and I felt a headache-inducing pressure, so I stopped buying the tech. Since that was literally decades ago, I decided to try out the new tech. So, the caveats to this section are that I cannot compare them to the AirPods Pro 2 (supposedly better than the Beats) or the AirPods Pro 1 (supposedly not as good). Also, I live in a cabin in the woods and don't have a lot of noise to cancel. My overall impression was that the effect of the noise cancellation was - subtle. I ran two tests. First, I used the buds with some kind of power tool being used on a construction site about 100 yards away. It was loud enough to be annoying with the buds out. Just putting them in my ears accomplished some passive isolation. As you would expect, turning on ANC made the volume lower, and Transparency made the volume louder. With no music playing, I could hear the noise in all three modes. Playing music, the noise completely disappeared. The second test was in my living room with the tv on. The results were the same. I am satisfied with the sound cancellation on these buds. They don't hiss or buzz, they don't produce a sensation of pressure, and they remain comfortable after a few hours of use. I think whether the sound cancellation is good enough for you will depend on what sound you are trying to cancel and what other products you have tried.The one glaring flaw that prevented my giving them 5 stars is the way volume control works. First, the physical buttons can be used for EITHER volume control or changing noise cancellation modes. Whichever one is not chosen can be controlled by the phone or by Siri. I think the whole purpose of these bud is for activities where you don't want to be carrying/looking at your phone. Siri works (sometimes) but there is an annoying lag. Also, using Siri to move volume up and down is slow, hard to predict the amount of change, and requires spoken commands, often repeated ones. Not ideal in many situations. Also, if you set the button to control volume, they are ""fiddley"". There is a lag before adjustment begins, and it is then hard to stop it where you want it. Seriously, the one control I most use when listening to music is volume control. It needs to be done right. The Beats Fit Pro implementation is a big step down from the physical controls on the Powerbeats.Overall, I like these buds and am going to keep them. Should you buy them? Speculation is that the second generation is coming late 2023 or early 2024. Speculation is that they will get the superior sound cancellation currently available on the AirPods Pro 2. Will they get the upgraded ""Find My"" capability? Will they finally fix the volume control issue? No one knows. So, as always with tech, the decision to buy or wait depends on what you have now, how important potential improvements are to you, and how confident you are with feature and timing predictions.","Reviewed in the United States August 4, 2023",AHOLKA6LYBP76IOHUUWJZRBNZRQA,1,28,Color: Tidal BlueStyle: Fit ProSet: Without AppleCare+,Beats Fit Pro (1st Gen),0.17475517827080325,0.49185455747955736,Neutral

Gulley,5,"I rarely write reviews, but when I find a product that not only does what it is supposed to do, but exceeds what is advertised, I must spred the word.I have tried many ear buds, both wired and wireless with little satisfaction. I am hard of hearing and I miss many of the high notes, even with my hearing aids on. The Beats Fit Pro are not hearing aids, but I am hearing highs that I haven't herd in years. My hearing aids cost me more than $3000. and listening to music with the beats is much clearer than my expensive aids. The highs are crisp and clear and base i nearly perfect. I havent been this impressed with a product in years. If you are an Apple user, then you are in for an added bonus as the Beats Fit Pro takes advantage of many of Iphone, Ipad, and Mac features. My only wish is that the battery would last a little longer as I like to sleep wearing them. The 7 hours isn't quite long enough for all night use, but close enough. Some wirless buds will last longer on a single charge, but at the expense of sound quality. The price currently is just slightly higher than many of the off brand buds and is worth every penny. The Beats Fit Pro are great, best purchase I have made on line in a very long time.","Reviewed in the United States June 19, 2024",AFBTTTNRF6WHC4KLRHJEG7XXMTFA,1,7,Color: Sage GrayStyle: Fit ProSet: Without AppleCare+,Beats Fit Pro (1st Gen),0.2087687074829932,0.5171224489795918,Positive
RE6HW0SD8290E,B09JL41N9C,4.0 out of 5 stars Patience required,Colleen,4,"I needed a new noise cancelling headphone to replace my old Bose earbuds. I wanted something wireless so I wouldn’t run into the problem I experience with my Bose earbuds - Apple changed the port again. So, I bought Beats since they had such good reviews. For the first couple of days I thought I was going to have to return them due to very muted sound through the right one. Plus, I have small ears and the darned thing hurt after just a few minutes. After reading a few articles, I did a hard reset but to no avail. It was finally on the 3rd reset and turning my iPhone off completely for a bit before repairing the Beats that I had success. As far as the fit, if you play around enough you’ll find an acceptable placement while still getting a good seal. But, patience and persistence paid off. These are good earbuds and I think I’m going to really like them. They have excellent sound quality and noise cancellation.","Reviewed in the United States June 29, 2024",AH5ZME4LHEARCENG3QVCCM6H7Q3Q,1,1,Color: Tidal BlueStyle: Fit ProSet: Without AppleCare+,Beats Fit Pro (1st Gen),0.19621645021645023,0.43761038961038956,Neutral

RKDKPF4JF91SL,B09JL41N9C,4.0 out of 5 stars Best Pair Of Wireless Buds I've Bought,BZS,4,"I've had my eyes on these, the original Bose Quiet Comforts, and the 2nd generation of the Airpods Pro. I was able to get them on sale for a good deal on Amazon, so I thought I'd take a chance on them. Worst comes to worst I just return them. So here is my honest review after an afternoon of using them...As a preface: I am a longtime owner of Powerbeats Pro (the ones that fit around your ear). While I loved the battery life, the design of the charging case leads to a ton of charging issues and thus ability to use them. The headphones get loose when you're not using them if you don't precisely place them right, so when you go to use them they may not have a charge. I never liked the loop around your ears headphones either as it would give the back of my ear a rash/irritate my skin for some reason (may just be me, so keep that in mind).1. I've seen a lot of people saying the wing tip that helps secure the bud in your ears irritates theirs. This was a major concern for me when I first opened them. I spent a couple of hours wearing them, and even while working out, I felt no discomfort. Based on some other reviews, I'd say the shape/what your ear looks like matters. Mine feel fine though, so no complaints there. I work out a ton, so I'll be curious to see how they hold up.2. I noticed a ton of ANC debates in reviews for these, but there are debates regarding the ANC capabilities of other headphones (ex. Bose Quiet Comforts, which Bose is deemed the king of ANC). It is all relative, in my opinion. I used to have a pair of Airpod pros, and in my opinion, the ANC is just as good. I think it depends on what you can reference, but I have 0 complaints in the ANC on the Beats Fit Pro.3. An area I do agree with others on is the case... This thing is TINY. Way more than I thought, which is nice given you can really take them anywhere. The problem is the material, like others point out. It feels like plastic and is so slippery it feels like you could easily let it slip out of your hands. So be careful there I'd say.4. As Beats, ahem Apple, transition from USB to USB-C, a major let down is the fact you HAVE to be able to charge the Beats Fit Pro with a USB-C charger block, a Macbook, etc. So if you are thinking about getting these, buy one in advance or when you purchase them. They case charges super fast though, which is nice.5. I really like the look of these ear buds when compared to others. I never liked the look of Airpods, and the Bose Quiet comforts have always looked a little weird. Low profile and just overall look nice.Overall review: I'm pretty satisfied with the Beats Fit Pro. The fact I got them on sale from $200 to $150 is an absolute bonus as well. The ANC is good (does what I need/want), 6 hours of charge, with 15 minute fast charging if you for some reason need it, and overall look makes me pretty happy. I'll be curious to see how I feel overtime of course, but as of right now, I'd recommend them if you're looking for some ear buds. I'd say keep in mind how the winged tip has irritated other's ears as that may depend on your overall shape of your ear.Overall grade: B+ (Only because of the case material, how easy it is to drop it, and the mandatory USB-C charging)Edit: Be careful buying from Amazon. Your headphones can clearly not be new despite saying you are buying them new. My warranty, when I bought them in the beginning of May, only runs till the end of October 2023. If you buy any Apple product, I believe, you get a full year limited warranty. They look new, but you don't get them in the typical plastic wrap Apple headphones come in. What you get for buying them at a good price though, so assuming I have no issues, this should be okay. Still satisfied none the less!","Reviewed in the United States May 5, 2023",AFRATEP246MOENSBSXOOA3LA5GXA,1,62,Color: Sage GrayStyle: Fit ProSet: Without AppleCare+,Beats Fit Pro (1st Gen),0.1513867601196369,0.5636215762928092,Neutral
R3O9HACBPLU4S1,B09JL41N9C,4.0 out of 5 stars Not without its flaws,J. Kerekes,4,"The ""spatial audio"" gimmick feature cannot be turned completely off and is awful. One has to keep their head in one rigid orientation to be able to hear the music at normal volume; if you turn your head to the right, the left audio channel gets quieter. Very distracting and stupid feature. You can turn it ""off"" but it still activates on some audio sources (like youtube videos) where it just becomes an annoyance.That aside, the fit is good, the batteries lasts a good while, and the case and earphones have survived two separate 2ft drops onto hard surfaces. The sound is good but a lil bass heavy. Phone calls are fine but the person you're talking to will hear a lot of environmental noise, like traffic and wind.Overall, these are a great choice if you have $180-200 burning a hole in your pocket; certainly better than the $30 wireless earbuds I've had in the past - but not in proportion to the price difference. However, if you'd be watching or listening to a lot of youtube videos with these, you should probably get something else.","Reviewed in the United States June 5, 2024",AGCY7CTKNVITSE4O5PQO6CGWACXQ,1,3,Color: Volt YellowStyle: Fit ProSet: Without AppleCare+,Beats Fit Pro (1st Gen),0.15803571428571433,0.5326190476190477,Neutral

I’m very physically active and any time I start moving and sweating I’ve had issues with earbuds falling out. These stayed put and the sound quality is fantastic. The plus about these is that they are push as opposed touch active. Most earbuds that you have to touch or tap to answer a call or pause music are way too sensitive. With these being push/press active, gives a little more control. They are higher in price but they are worth it based on the quality, and performance. I will say that I did wish the battery life was a little longer but that’s minor considering I can make it almost a whole shift before I have put them in the case to charge. The only thing I really don’t like is the case. It does seem a bit flimsy and like if dropped without a protective case, it would crack or the hinge part can break easy.","Reviewed in the United States June 29, 2024",AFQSGQMILO5JRG227KEVUHWQKOOA,1,10,Color: Stone PurpleStyle: Fit ProSet: Without AppleCare+,Beats Fit Pro (1st Gen),0.150462962962963,0.5314814814814814,Neutral

R1BP17EAFK1IR6,B09JL41N9C,"4.0 out of 5 stars I LIKE THEM, but It's because it's what I was looking for",Klaus Haraldsson,4,"A 4 star rating is very fair for these, I wish I could give them a 4.5 though. While searching for new earbuds, I had three things that I was looking for. If you aren't looking for what I was, which it can be 50/50, then you may be better off going with another option (Like Bose).Grip, Comfortability, and Ease of Use.In terms of Grip, I wanted a pair of earbuds that would stay on my ear. If I were to go for a run, work out, or play basketball I wanted earbuds that would rarely or never fall out. I had recently had a pair of the AirPods Pro, and they DID NOT workout for me, as they would fall out of my ear VERY EASILY. With the Beats Fit Pro, the little wing tip that goes on the inner part of your ear, aside from the actual earbud that goes inside of your ear, actually provides GREAT grip, and I've been able to do my workouts without these falling off. I also thing that since these earbuds DO NOT STICK OUT OF YOUR EAR as much as a BOSE or AirPods Pro do, that it adds more grip to stay on your ear.In terms of comfortability, this should be fairly straight forward. I've had cheap earbuds were after an hour or so of wearing them, your ear starts to get very sore. So much so, that it even hurt to take them off. So far, the Beat Fit Pro earbuds have been pretty good so far. I played around with the different size earbuds that they provide, and have found the size for me. I did noticed that, you have to play around with how they fit in your ear in order to get that ""perfect fit"" we are all looking for. When I first put them on, I had to rotation the earbud and play around with where the wing tip would go, before I found the spot that works for me. I just recently went on a 4 hour flight, and throughout the whole trip, my ear did not get sore.Regarding the Ease of Use, it was very simple to connect the Beats, and it is also very simple to change the settings from Noise Canceling, to Transparency, to turning both of those off if you wish. You do not need to download an app or anything, which is amazing for me as I hate the earbuds where you need to download an app and create an account, etc. I give this a 5/5.Now, there are things that are not the best when it comes to the Beats Fit Pro, that I think other earbuds will work better.Sound, and Noise Cancelation.I would give the sound a 3.5/5. It is not the loudest, doesn't have the best bass, and it's not the most profound. What I mean by profound, is those headphones in which you can hear every sound that goes into a certain beat. This is where I think, that if an amazing sound is all you care about, then going with a Bose might be better for you. At it's loudest volume, the Beats Fit Pro are really not that loud. I've had headphones were you can't stay on the loudest volume because it's simply just to loud. It's kind of the opposite with the Beats. The loudest they go, is about how I like them when I listen to music.Now, the Noise Cancelation on the Beats Fit Pro DOES WORK. I tried them in my house, and had some of my friends talk to me, and I really could not hear a word they were saying. I like that in the Beats Fit Pro, it is VERY EASY to turn the Noise Canceling feature off. HOWEVER, when in a relatively medium sounding environment, the Beats Fit Pro, won't fully block out all the sound. Even worse, if you are in a large sounding environment, you will 100% be able to hear everything going on. This most likely has to do with the lack of sound that I was explaining on the previous paragraph. I feel that if the sound was louder and more profound on the Beats, the Noise Cancelation would be much better.If you happen to read my long description, I hope this help!","Reviewed in the United States October 24, 2022",AHSA34L25CYRE4DF2VS5NFDW53SQ,1,436,Color: Beats BlackStyle: Fit ProSet: Without AppleCare+,Beats Fit Pro (1st Gen),0.2552294087491455,0.5245977158806104,Positive

I found these and decided to try it since they were on sale. Right out of the box they were a very nice fit (I do change tips occasionally) and the sound was better than my 510s. Fast forward to now and they have been the best things I’ve ever played audio out of. I’ve seen people saying the case is a little flimsy, and I can see the point there. However, I’ve dropped the case three times in the same day by accident (twice when getting in and out of a suburban and once in the house down the stairs) and it’s only got tiny dents to show for the concrete drops.

I thought I'd like these and wouldn't switch back to AirPods however I was incorrect. The speakers sound is starting to go in and out especially if I am on the phone or a conference call. These were great to connect to a work laptop but now, people can barely hear me speaking. Originally these were bought for the noise cancelling quality and color option but I'm not sure I got my moneys worth for one year of use. Having kids and dogs around was the main reason I bought them but again they started to deteriorate around the 1 year mark. The noise cancelling quality isn't up to par with the AirPod Pros since I can still hear the dogs barking.If you only want headphones to last one year then these are the headphones for you. I'd recommend them then. But long term and time usage isn't on there side.","Reviewed in the United States May 9, 2024",AGHK4IZ5ZR5GCA2AUD5GDCZZFPRQ,1,1,Color: MoonStyle: Fit ProSet: Without AppleCare+,Beats Fit Pro (1st Gen),0.1279761904761905,0.4206349206349206,Neutral

I considered buying Apple branded wireless earbuds, but the Beats earbuds are just as tightly integrated as the Apple earbuds, and they offer superior features for a lower cost. They walk you through selecting the right size for the cups for your ears and they have a built-in audio check to ensure you're getting a good seal. I wear these on the treadmill; they are comfortable, the battery life is exactly as advertised, and the sound quality is amazing. I work out at a Planet Fatness, and they do a great job of blocking out noises and distractions around me, allowing me to focus on my run. They work pretty well for phone calls and they do have a feature where you can long-press and have it do several different things (by default, it will enable transparency--and it seems like you're not wearing earbuds at all).

R35LEDCWE9RBVL,B09JL41N9C,3.0 out of 5 stars Very disappointing for what Beats is supposed to be,Cecil Aragon,3,"I am very disappointed in these earbuds. The first problem is that the ANC is not as good as you would think. The second problem is the lack of good bass. I mean these are Beats. They cost sooo much compared to earbuds from lesser known brands, and so you would think that they would be the best quality, but they aren't.I am not a name brand person at all. However, the ONLY reason I bought these is because I was looking for earbuds that would not fall out of my ear like my others do. These are the ONLY ones that I could find that have a hook to keep them in my ear. So I broke down and bought them. Well, they do stay in my ear which is the one positive.Now on to the disappointing negatives.1) ANC - the active noise cancellation is there, but it isn't as strong as my other earbuds that were less than half the price of these Beats. I am using them at the gym, and they just don't cancel out as much noise as my others and I am super disappointed in that. I can still hear too much ambient noise.2) Bass - the bass on these is sorely lacking. Again, my less expensive earbuds have way better bass than these - the known name brand expensive earbuds. I literally stood there in my kitchen and traded the Beats back and forth in my ears with my less expensive ones and no matter how much I tried to have the Beats come out with greater bass, they just don't.So in the end, for me, these are mediocre quality earbuds for way too much. I don't know if we're allowed to mention other brands on here so I won't but I will say that the overall sound quality and the ANC on my cheaper earbuds is way better. Again, the one positive is that these don't fall out of my ears. All that for so much more money.","Reviewed in the United States June 10, 2024",AFU6RZBAB6LPD5ZRQP3VMCS6NSKA,1,4,Color: Tidal BlueStyle: Fit ProSet: Without AppleCare+,Beats Fit Pro (1st Gen),0.010247359963269038,0.4635646235078052,Neutral

The earbuds themselves are very high quality, sound great, feel great, and play nice with everything in the Apple ecosystem because of the H1 chip. Which is a plus for me, as I’m an Apple user on most things.I feel like Apple is likely going to release an updated version of these in the near future, as it’s been like 2+ years now.

Gave this a 4 out of 5 stars but in my words here’s why…Purchased these in replace of the newest AirPod Pros… AirPods were constantly falling out my ears, hurting my little tiny ears, a(n)extremely uncomfortable and unpleasant time. 0 out of 10 do not recommend! Seriously. I think this is good decent product. You can say I’m pretty satisfied with my purchase. First off, love the color. Really adore that part. Purposely purchased the color because not only is it giving baddie.. it blends with my skin tone, damn near perfectly. So when I’m at work, or even if my hair is up, or just even out and about, people can’t even tell I have earbuds in. Very discreet and convenient for that reason. I can’t tell you how many times I’ve been asked if they are hearing aids at work lol. They also do not fall out whatsoever. Like seriously. These babies ain’t going no where. Haven’t tried working out in them yet but I think it’ll be fine even with sweating. Really great sound quality, features (ex. noise cancellation *chefs kiss*), and super comfortable. Love that you can adjust to whatever shape or size your ear is! Along with the buds being very flexible. Even hours after wearing they may start to get a little uncomfortable and you can fix and adjust them so you don’t have any issues. Audio is excellent and great phone call/FaceTime quality as well. No complaints with sound. When i’m on the phone people be hearing TOO much lol. The ONLY negative(s) I have to say are that honestly probably wouldn’t purchase them again not for sound or feature reasons but the overall quality for the price! Definitely way over priced but I get it because it is a Kim Kardashian promoted product.. but atleast make the material more attractive and sturdy in regards tothe quality. Case that the beats are stored in is very light weight .. like too light. It really feels and looks cheaply made. Like they should be $45 at THE Walmart Supercenter .. Love the flexibility of the buds themselves but dislike the overall quality of the case the earbuds are stored in. The case also charges the buds as well and lasts throughout my 12 hour shift with battery to listen and not having to charge them at any point during my shift. I’ve really only seen it had them die a couple of times on me and that’s really my fault for forgetting to charge them lol. Really wished they could’ve used a more sustainable and STURDY material. Otherwise, everything else checks out and I will say that these are wayyy better than AirPods (at least for me and my small ears) and for reference I have had each version of the AirPods. Very comfortable, can tune people and surroundings out so easily. Love that part. ANYWAYS thanks for reading! That’s the Tea✨✨ hope you decide topurchase!! You may or may not regret it lol.

R223ZZV2VR18TP,B09JL41N9C,"5.0 out of 5 stars By Far, One of the Best",LPB,5,"I have bought over time more than a few sets of ""in ear earbuds"" that were supposedly ""noise cancelling."" Let me tell ya, the cheap ones that advertise that function I have to believe are lying. In reality, it doesn't appear that cheaper buds have any such noise cancelling technology. You can generally determine this if there seems to be no method to actually turn off the alleged noise cancelling, i.e., you can't turn off what's not there in the first place. And there would certainly be a way to turn off noise cancelling if it existed because doing so would save so much power and extend the life of your buds by several hours. So remember folks, if you're buying some 40 dollar buds that supposedly have noise cancelling tech: think again. Additionally, some of the earbuds I've bought previously also had over-the-ear hooks, because the ones without that device invariably fell out of my ear. The problem with my ears is that even with the ear hooks/loops, they could come out of my ears and just dangle there. Really annoying. None of my prior ones were expensive, but I finally decided to pony up and buy something a little expensive that I'd hoped I would like and be more effective: the Beats Fit Pro. They don't use a hook over the ear, they have a smaller soft loop that hooks INSIDE your ear. Totally different concept, but for me it works! I have no idea how well it'll work for others, but for me it's a godsend. They are stable and have no tendency to fall out. I put sound muffs over them when I'm cutting the grass on an extremely loud mower so I can listen to tunes when cutting and they haven't fallen out yet. And importantly, there is real and functional noise cancelling technology in these things. It can be controlled either by a button on one of the buds or by your smartphone, and it actually works. But be aware, it's not super great! It really does work: honestly there is real noise cancelling happening. But I've yet to use a noise cancelling technology that was super-effective, and this is no different. But at least it's real and there and does do something. And finally, there's the sound: they sound very good, and offer a good bit more bass response than the other earbuds I've used. You're never going to find earbuds that sound as good as proper set of headphones, but these sound really good. I'd buy these again--right now--as well as recommend them.

R18670RYHHDHN5,B09JL41N9C,5.0 out of 5 stars if you're a runner- YES YES YES.,G,5,"invested in this because i finally had the money for decent wireless earbuds, and i saw great, detailed reviews from runners like myself. i am SO GLAD i did!Pros- never, EVER am i worried about these bad boys falling out of my ear. and i run hard- first run I had with these was an 8 mile run, and i was catching 100ft inclines in wind...they were AMAZING! if you're on the go, a runner, whatever, and you want something that will stay, this is for you! as far as noise-cancellation, i used them at work and it turned my loud coworker into a blissful, dim whisper! don't even get me started on the sound quality, especially the spatial surround...first song i heard made me tear up. sooo much better than what i'd been using before (basic wired lightning apple earbuds- hardy and reliable for about a year, but good for $20). battery life is AMAZING! i listened for 8 straight hours at work and only went to charge them when i went home, just because i had to put them back in the case. the case itself charged the earbuds at least 6 times before hitting 20% and i wanted to charge it just in case i needed it the next day (i will say, they weren't all 0 to 100% charges, more like the earbuds were down to 20-60% before i put em away, so you be the judge.) still, WAYYYY better than generic bluetooth earbuds that are obnoxious and die all the time. the earbuds also can work INDEPENDENT of each other! this includes noise cancellation! (so if you have a noisy coworker like me who sits on one side of you, and only one earbud is charged... you get it!) color is also true to advertising! beautiful lilac purple shade. and for range- just today I was doing laundry and didn't realize I had left my phone in my locked apartment one floor up and two large, closed rooms over until i was in the middle of moving a load to the dryer! seriously, it is POWERFUL.cons - they can hurt your ears if you leave them in for hours at a time, where the hooks rest. but for the quality...honestly, after an hour or two straight, just take a break! for noise cancellation, on runs it can make you feel like you're hitting altitude in an airplane, but DO NOT use noise cancellation on runs anyway! you need to hear cars and other potential hazards around you! and i haven't had issues with it on a treadmill, so this really isn't necessarily a con. :) they don't support wireless charging! and it only comes with a usbc (or whatever it's called) charger, neither end is a USB and it does not include a wall plug! however those you can buy for dirt cheap at walmart or meijer, so fret not. i usually use the usc slot on my work computer to charge mine. like others have said, case does feel a little flimsy so i might get a hard shell for it just in case.TLDR: if you're a runner, or have a noisy coworker, or on the go and want great sound quality and battery life, GET THEM! They are so worth the money.","Reviewed in the United States March 13, 2023",AHQENTDGUTJVQX4XN56XBGJRMVEQ,1,113,Color: Stone PurpleStyle: Fit ProSet: Without AppleCare+,Beats Fit Pro (1st Gen),0.18457681683784627,0.564394646747588,Neutral

These were my first high-end buds in a few years, so it was fun to discover the spatial aspect. All settings were easily accessible and well organized.As others have mentioned, the case feels very flimsy and pops open easily when dropped and had to look for one bud under the couch at one point. This isn’t too big of a deal if you get one of the zip up accessory cases.With all of the positives noted below, I really wanted these to be my new buds.

R157LGUAIEIW85,B09JL41N9C,4.0 out of 5 stars Good but only good.,RW414,4,"2024-08-02: As We strive to hold Ourselves to the highest editorial standard an update is in order. These are very decent earbuds (with a surprisingly good battery) hampered by the implicit lie of the wing-things. Get them but don't expect the wing-things to last (or just get AirPods if you're in an iOS ecosystem). The 3.5 is accordingly raised to a full 4.2023-08-07: I am going to upgrade this to a 4 star (which is really a 3.5). They're decent buds and, while the wing-thing should be user-replaceable, it's a bit of a belt-and-suspenders thing (unless you're hanging upside-down or have the world's oiliest ears you should be fine even when they fall off, which they probably will). They're ok. Not sure there's a reason to go with them over current-gen AirPods.So I'm going to assume here that you're looking at these and going ""Oh hey, they're as iOS-integrative as AirPods but they also have a little wing-thing that holds them in: neat!"" because that was my thought process too.Let's dispense with the positive first: The earbuds are good if maybe not great at their core functionality (playing sound), the H1 chip makes pairing these with iOS really easy and it integrates with iOS well. The buds look good and they're fairly comfortable (I think my ears are pretty normal), The sound quality and battery life and noise cancellation were all good, certainly good enough to recommend. No physical volume controls so bear that in mind.Most negative reviews seem to focus on how the case is trash and it very much is: the surface is made from a slippery plastic (feels different from the plastic of the earbuds) and has a single hinge that doesn't feel very secure (it relies on the case magnet to stay closed), the case doesn't show up on FindMy (the buds do which is a nice feature). The case feels in a word ""cheap"" which is a problem at this price. It's actually strange how much the case feels like it belongs to an entirely different product!My issue isn't with the case though, it's with what I talked about above as being the reason I bought it, the product-defining feature: the little wing-thing that holds it to the ear. If you use these regularly but have to remove them often the wing *will* start to tear at the ""stem"" near the connection between it and the bud. That needn't have been a problem (or at least not a problem serious enough to not recommend it) if the wings were user-replaceable but they aren't. This is user-unfriendly design: if you have a multi-component device the failure of a non-core component which doesn't compromise the functionality of the core component should be removable and replaceable by the end user to maximize the service life of the device. Additionally, from an accessibility perspective removable wing-things would make the device usable by people with a broader range of ear sizes (in much the same way as eartips are variably sized).A $200 set of earbuds with a product-defining feature (the wing) shouldn't have that feature made from a material that doesn't have the tensile strength to accomplish the purpose of the feature (hold the bud to the ear) while tolerating the stress implied by that function and that of removal/insertion to the ear. The wing itself rests on the case surface with slight tension when the buds are clicked into the case and I suspect this doesn't do anything to improve their lifespan either. All of that might even be excusable if the design were modular enough to allow user replacement of the stressed components but they haven't done that.To sum up: Good earbuds, terrible case, interesting and product-defining wings but with poor materials choices and bad modularity. I don't have a suggestion as to what you should get but it shouldn't be this.","Reviewed in the United States April 22, 2022",AGRQVXOCVOHQKBIVNZBSGXQKLKFA,1,41,Color: Beats BlackStyle: Fit ProSet: Without AppleCare+,Beats Fit Pro (1st Gen),0.12093770041686706,0.4888902969458526,Neutral

R1YCY2ISTC6WYR,B09JL41N9C,"4.0 out of 5 stars Missing Features, but Solid Overall",Josh Rodine,4,"Generally speaking, I like these a lot. I use my earbuds almost exclusively for working out, so fit and comfort are very high on my list. I tend to have a hard time keeping earbuds in my ears, but the ""wings"" on these do a magnificent job of holding the earbuds in place. I'm not much of an audiophile, but I think the sound quality is pretty good. Nice bass, and the treble isn't to tinny.Now for my complaints (and there are a few). My most recent buds were Sennheiser Momentum 3. They had a ton of features that the Beats Fit Pro lack. There's no customizable EQ. You can't control both volume and ANC/Transparency with the buttons on the buds (you can do both, but you have to choose whether the buds will control volume or the ANC/Transparency features--whichever you don't select has to be controlled through the device on which you're listening. This is really annoying for someone who is working out and not holding a phone. Ideally, I'd be able to control all of these features (i.e., playback start/stop/ff/rew, volume, and ANC) through the buttons on the buds (which was the case with the Sennheisers). That said, I really do appreciate that these have buttons rather than touch sensors (the later of which are far too easily activated by something simple like readjusting the position of the bud in the ear).","Reviewed in the United States March 26, 2024",AEQPR5N42OOFL3SDJNXZPSKBLQDA,1,0,Color: Beats BlackStyle: Fit ProSet: Without AppleCare+,Beats Fit Pro (1st Gen),0.1908939393939394,0.5458701298701298,Neutral

I never could get my AirPod Pros to fit properly even with 3rd party ear-tips and they were constantly falling out of my ears!These Beats have the H1 chip, Active Noise Cancelling, Spacial Audio and are 'Find My' compatible. I've paired them with my iPhone 14 Pro Max, iPad Pro and Mac Studio with no issues.The only negatives would be that the included USB-C cable is very short but shouldn't really matter since most people have numerous longer cables. The bigger issues is with the case. It's extremely light weight and very slick so it could possibly be easy to drop. I just ordered a cheap silicon case for it which I really shouldn't have had to do if they designed it better in the first place. And it doesn't support wireless charging like the newer AirPod Pro cases if that's important to you.

R2I11IJ6RSPC38,B09JL41N9C,5.0 out of 5 stars Great Fitness Headphones,Baer,5,"I purchased these to replace my Bose Soundsport Free headphones that stopped charging after 4 faithful years of use. I also own a pair of AirPods Pro headphones and felt like trying something in the Apple ecosystem after using various Bose headphones for my workouts over the last 10 years.The AirPods will not stay in my ears, and as a heavy sweater, I need earphones with the rubber wings to stop them sliding out. The Beats stay in perfectly fine and have a smaller profile than my Bose Soundsports did and the connectivity is seamless with my iPhone. If you have a set of AirPods these will be totally intuitive. The sound quality is identical to me and the Active Noise Cancelling (ANC) is a nice feature my old Bose headphones did not have, it does enough to drown out road noise and treadmill whirring. However, the ANC on these is not as good as AirPods and the sound quality while very close to AirPods, is perceptively lower (I really only notice if I go from listening to my AirPods to the Beats). The Beats are great if you need something for workouts and enjoy the Apple ecosystem, but if you’re just walking around town the AirPods Pro are better in almost every regard minus the staying in your ears. You can also adjust the volume on the Beats without using your phone, this is a massive plus if you are using them with Garmin fitness watches. I have music on my Garmin watch and nothing is worse than having to stop my run to cycle through my apps to turn my volume up or down (an obnoxious problem with AirPods).The only thing my old Bose headphones did better was durability for both the headphones and charging case. As other have pointed out the Beats case feels flimsy and cheap compared to an otherwise premium experience. I have dropped, sat on, and ran in rainstorms with my Bose headphones and never had any issues with water exposure. The portable Bose case feels much heavier and durable. While both the Beats and Bose headphones have the same IPX4 rating the Bose feel solid (this is just perception), however, the Bose were also bigger and heavier in my ears and I had ear fatigue after a few hours.If you need a quality sounding pair of fitness these are awesome. The market is saturated with wireless fitness earbuds and in most cases you won’t go wrong with name brands. However, these Beats checked the most boxes for me and as someone who is already well invested in the Apple ecosystem these were a no-brainer.","Reviewed in the United States January 24, 2023",AGEMXONKY2DG7AL2BPUSIKRX2YOQ,1,28,Color: Beats BlackStyle: Fit ProSet: Without AppleCare+,Beats Fit Pro (1st Gen),0.17955840455840458,0.5168091168091169,Neutral

Especially because I could get these buds and essentially ""keep my airpods"" I thought since they're internally the same, but this wasn't the case.I'm on my second pair of these because the first ones didn't connect properly, stay connected, then they wouldn't update. So I got another pair that didn't have these problems except for the connectivity. It's still spotty, ANC is there but definitely not even as good as the 2nd Gen AirPod Pro's I replaced. I will say I appreciate the controls on these much more than the stalks on the AirPods, if you didn't grip those just right they wouldn't work anyway.Overall they're not bad, but they're overpriced even at a discounted sale of ~$170 considering that AirPods do still outperform these in so many little ways.

RAUKXC8YQKMSG,B09JL41N9C,3.0 out of 5 stars Very underwhelming,William R.,3,"First off, let me say, these are ok. I didn't have any issues or problems with them at all. The worked, paired easily, sounded good and stayed put pretty decent for my workout.Why the mid line review then?Well, I was just underwhelmed by the buds. For pushing almost $200, I expect something really high end, and something with some more adaptability, and these aren't that.First of all, the sound was good, but it didn't blow me away, and in that price point, I expected more. Second, the fit was ok, borderline not so good. I bought these for the gym. Now I am a big guy, and have big ears, probably bigger than most, but the ""wings"" on these buds were worthless for me, they were so small in my ear they provided absolutely no function what so ever. Again, for this price point, I would have thought these might come with some additional ""wings"" to adapt to each ear, that isn't the case. Last, I wasn't crazy about the ear tips, the selection wasn't great and they didn't provide a better seal or fit, in fact I used a pair of tips from another much cheaper brand that worked way better than what they provided with these.So in conclusion, the price point and what I got for the money wasn't enough for me to keep them. In fact, I bought another brand on here (off brand) and they have better sound, an app with an equalizer for custom sound, super stable and a fraction of the price so I kept those and returned the beats. I really wanted to love these, and don't mind paying for it if they are worth it, but these in my opinion were nowhere near worth the money spent.","Reviewed in the United States June 6, 2024",AH35BYCKVPKTNTSSJ6OSI5DHMEKA,1,3,Color: Sage GrayStyle: Fit ProSet: Without AppleCare+,Beats Fit Pro (1st Gen),0.2415079365079366,0.45373015873015876,Positive
RJG9AE59EE4E8,B09JL41N9C,4.0 out of 5 stars Very good fitness earbuds,Alex Rogers,4,"I got these earbuds for three reasons: I wanted something sweat-proof that would stay put on my finicky ears regardless of what kind of fitness training I'm doing, I wanted to have the same functionality as my Airpod pros, and I wanted to have a second pair of earbuds with a long-lasting battery for those end-to-end meetings days, where my Airpods just don't last long enough.This purchase pretty much fulfills my needs quite nicely: The Beats Fit Pro fit my ears snuggly, and so far I have not been able to shake them off at all; not even make the budge a bit; and yet, they're amazingly comfortable. They're very unobtrusive, even when lying down on my side and pressing my arm against my ear.The sound is very good, and while I have not really taxed the battery to the max yet, it does seem to last quite a long time. The specs say that each charge will last 6 hours, and I'm willing to believe it.The charger box is beautifully designed, and the earbuds fall into place with a very satisfying magnetic click, which ensures that the do not move from the box even if the box falls down with the lid open (great news for those who keep losing their earbuds!).The fact that I was able to get these for about $50 less than the Airpods Pro was a definite plus.As far as Apple compatibility is concerned, these work as advertised: instant recognition by all my Apple devices, smoothly switching from MacBook to iPhone to iPad; spatial sound, Find My - it all works.On the score-reduction side, I found it disappointing that the box does not charge wirelessly. Not a big deal, but it's just one of those little comfort details.The sound, while quite good, is definitely noticeably less crisp than with the Airpods. There seems to be a bit more emphasis on the bass, and a slight muffling of the sharp end that made feel less that thrilled with the output.Probably the most disappointing aspect is the active noise cancellation. It is there, it works, but it is far, far less effective than that provided by the Airpods Pro. I haven't had the opportunity to test them in something like an airplane yet, but just walking around the house and neighborhood, I can clearly hear a lot of noises that are almost completely drowned by the Airpods. This even after trying the different silicone pad sizes and ensuring that the noise cancellation test indicated a ""perfect"" seal.I would, therefore, not recommend these for demanding audiophiles, or those seeking a deep isolation experience. But for the purpose I got them, as good, reliable, comfortable fitness earbuds, they're perfect.","Reviewed in the United States December 26, 2022",AFSHXPEFJDVHSOB2C4FVKKIWKCFA,1,38,Color: Beats WhiteStyle: Fit ProSet: Without AppleCare+,Beats Fit Pro (1st Gen),0.20031305114638448,0.5235361552028219,Positive

R2QSTU7T2KL6P2,B09JL41N9C,2.0 out of 5 stars Hissing in microphone plus charging failure,R. Wellmore,2,"EXPANDED REVIEWI wrote my original review (3 stars) a few weeks ago and now I'm expanding it due to recent problems and decreasing the star rating to 2 stars.ORIGINAL REVIEWThese are my first noise-canceling (NC) earphones. I'm taking a trip involving very small airplanes so baggage weight is important. I wondered whether these NC earphones could replace my Bose NC headphones. No. I'm sure it's not a fair comparison but on a scale of 0 to 10 where my headphones merit a 9, these earphones get a 4. I tested in the bathroom with the (loud) fan running. It's curious that when I turn off NC, the noise is louder than with no earphones in at all! The fan noise is somehow getting amplified through the earphones. But the NC issue is not as bad as the microphone hissing. I recorded myself on Zoom and consider these earphones unusable for that. There is a loud hiss accompanying my voice. I tried turning NC off to see if that had anything to do with it, but the hiss was still there. I sure wouldn't want to hear that, so I won't subject my friends to it. I'll stick with my Powerbeats Pro earphones for use with Zoom. So what are these Beats Fit Pro earphones good for? Listening to music. And with the modicum of NC they do provide, I bet they'll be good on bike rides. Not too much NC so you can still hear the traffic but they take the noise edge off so you can hear the music well without jacking the volume up. Plus, with my Powerbeats Pro, I'd have to unfasten my helmet strap in order to get them on. With the Beats Fit Pro, I won't have to do that; I can just stick them in. Also, Duolingo doesn't mind the microphone hiss, so I can use them for that and the modicum of NC is nice when my housemates are being noisy. (The microphone on my Bose headphones is so bad, it's unusable.) Overall, I'm ok with this purchase. I'll still bring the Bose on my trip, but these earphones will be preferred for some things I do.ADDENDUMI'm writing this a few weeks after the original review. A few days ago, I noticed that the right earbud went dead and would not charge. I thought it couldn't be a seating problem the way there is with Powerbeats earphones because these Beats Fit Pro earphones snap into the case so assertively thanks to the magnets. But I pressed on the right earbud anyway and nope, no place to go. And things got worse. When I opened the case beside my iPad, there was no indication at all, no charge status, nothing, like the iPad wasn't picking up any Bluetooth signal at all even though the case had been plugged into power all night. So I pressed the button to go into pairing mode. After a few seconds, the iPad detected the case. Right earbud 0% charge. So I plugged the case in yet again, starting to suspect that it was the case that was malfunctioning, not the earbud. A few hours later, the right earbud was up to 100%. Pressing the pairing button had somehow gotten the charging circuitry back on track. I used the earphones a lot, always noting the charge level on both as I put them away in addition to when I open the case to use them. Then yesterday I had a situation where I opened the case near the iPad, the detection dialog appeared showing the case was charged to 100% and the earbuds were charged to 100%. Then I pulled the right earbud out. When you do that, the dialog usually shows the charge status of each earbud. But in this case, it didn't. It continued to show one earbud icon at 100%, as if there had only ever been the left earbud in the case, as if the right earbud had never been there. With the dialog still showing, I returned the right earbud to the case. It snapped in because of the magnet. No change to the dialog. I then pressed on the earbud and tried to wiggle it a little. I didn't feel anything move but nevertheless, when I pulled the right earbud out again, the dialog finally showed two earbuds with the left at 100% and the right at 74% which is what I had put it away at the day before. So there's definitely something wonky about the case. I'm glad I have Applecare but the geek in me wants to continue characterizing the problem. I wonder how widespread this is.","Reviewed in the United States December 25, 2022",AGCTPXL5366EV36I2LCUBBEAUVFA,1,7,Color: Sage GrayStyle: Fit ProSet: Without AppleCare+,Beats Fit Pro (1st Gen),0.07881161236424393,0.47709133945976046,Neutral

R2028I5PGDAG3L,B09JL41N9C,5.0 out of 5 stars All the benefits of AirPod pros but a more secure fit!,jdwilson,5,"I have had Airpods, Airpod Pros, Tozo NC2's, and several other sets of Bluetooth wireless headphones. Each one has different features that I really like and some features that are missing.Pros:The Beats Fit Pros really excel in many areas. They absolutely rival the sound of the last set of Airpod Pros I had. I honestly cannot think of one time that I've thought, ""These are good, but they aren't Airpod Pros."" The sound quality is excellent and the tap button on each ear make for really easy to use controls. I like having a tactile button that you can feel when it is pressed as opposed to some other versions that just use touch.The BEST feature of these, however, is the fit. They are really comfortable. So much so, that there are times that I forget I'm wearing them. And they do not fall out. I use them a lot (that's probably why they look a little dirty in the picture). I keep the case in my pocket all day while I'm at work. I use them to answer phone calls and I've found them to be very natural sounding. I also excercise in them regularly.One other tidbit...the noise cancelling is really good. I coach a volleyball team, and some of the match environments we go to are EXTREMELY loud. I wear these in NC mode, and it quiets everything done.Cons:Battery life. While I don't kill them super fast, if you wanted to leave home and wear them and use them all day...well, that's not going to happen. I've found that I put them in at 100% and go for a 1 hour run listening to podcasts or music and they are at about 80%. Constant use of music/phone calls, you might get a continuous 6 hours. However, the case does charge very quickly.The case. I don't love the feel of the case. It's really slick. It goes in and out of your pants pocket really easily, but it will also slip out of your hands easily as well. It doesn't feel badly, it's just a little slick for me. The other thing I don't love about the case is that I wish you had an idea of how much charge the case has without using your phone. I know the case and Beats Fit Pro vitals are meant to be read on the phone screen, but it would be nice to not have to sometimes.All in all, for $50+ savings on the Airpod Pros (sometimes even more than that) I would definitely buy again.","Reviewed in the United States April 5, 2023",AGMFL27BEGD3ZLU6TSMUELDKNHGA,1,66,Color: Beats BlackStyle: Fit ProSet: Without AppleCare+,Beats Fit Pro (1st Gen),0.2179166666666667,0.5159848484848485,Positive

R2X41UR9XA2T0S,B09JL41N9C,"4.0 out of 5 stars Sound great, stay put, but really not for those with small ears",BrCottle,4,"My past pair of airpods pro got totally destroyed in the wash, so I wanted to take a chance and see if there were any earbuds better than them for me. Heard a lot of good things about this pair, several review outlets (including the New York Times) include the beats fit pro (BFP) as essentially the best possible earbuds you can get right now. I honestly can see what they mean, they have a lot going for them, but one fatal flaw (in my case) that made me end up returning them. Even though they are such small earbuds, they are just too big for my ears! I consider myself an audiophile, I have quite small ears, and I use headphones for easily 5-7 hours a day whether that is on calls or listening to music/voice. I'm very picky about the tech I use, so whenever I stick with something it really has to be good.Here's what I've found in general for the things that were important to me, in particular in comparison to the AirPods Pro since that is what I was comparing them against ultimately:- The audio quality is *slightly* better. I found there is more separation in the instruments for both classical and pop-esque/modern music. There is a very appreciated increase in ""oomph"" and resonance from the bass with these headphones that I often found myself missing with the airpods pro. The BFP have that going for them.- The wing tips and overall design really helps them stay put. Because of my small ears, if I want to/try to I can usually wiggle earbugs out of my ears just by opening my mouth or chewing, but these really stayed put.- Unfortunately, they really are too big for my small ears. I've included a picture of the smallest earbud size on the BFP and the airpods pro for comparison, and there really is (to me) a significant difference. The BFP would become uncomfortable after just 10-20 minutes, then I would get used to it, then once I took them out my ears would start hurting again. Seems like they essentially made my ears numb to the pressure, but afterward it was quite uncomfortable.- Just for comparisons sake, the smallest airpods pro tip fits *perfectly* in my ears, and doesn't put any undue pressure anywhere. I can use them easily for working out, etc. This, along with the apparent higher call quality from the AirPods Pro made me stick with them again. If the beats fit more comfortably, I would have gone with them because I like that they are newer, the auto on-off worked better, longer battery life, and more satisfying audio quality.- a couple other notes: the ANC of the BFP is noticably worse than the airpods pro for me, but the really high quality transparency modes are about the same between the two.Those are my thoughts, returned these and went with AirPods Pro, since they still work *very* well, are very comfortable, and fit my particular needs quite nicely.","Reviewed in the United States July 12, 2022",AHTMKEIAPNLS6AMOSG64JNBR4EUQ,1,93,Color: Sage GrayStyle: Fit ProSet: Without AppleCare+,Beats Fit Pro (1st Gen),0.14443774479488763,0.5064459218030647,Neutral

R3K1BA2E69BDN9,B09V9P5Q6W,5.0 out of 5 stars Best Sound Quality and ANC out of my 15 pairs of earbuds,Resume Ryan,5,"I have a wireless earbud problem. From my first set 8 years ago, on through my inability to resist fantastic Woot deals, and including two other pairs of JBL buds, I have accumulated 15 sets. These JBL Live Pro blow EVERYTHING ELSE AWAY. I have the JBL Vibe 200TWS which are a great entry-set but lack premium build materials, have a narrower dynamic range, and aren't compatible with the JBL app. I also have JBL Tune 230NC TWS which I picked up on a great deal on Prime Day and have an impressively rich sound and work with the app so I can customize my own EQ - my only quibbles are that they don't get quite as loud as I want for music and the ANC is mediocre. Enter the Live Pro; game: changed.These have the most impressive dynamic range I have heard in any ear bud (I also have Galaxy Buds 2, Asus ROG buds, and bought [and returned] Raycon Everyday buds). They bring great, rich bass, warm midtones, and balanced high end sounds. The ANC is freakishly good. When I have a good seal, the only thing I can hear is my own inhalation (which sounds oddly like the opening of Every Rose Has its Thorn) and the build materials have a much more premium feel to them - metallic posts, great tips, an elliptical design which fits comfortably and tightly. The battery life is great, the app interface is useful for testing the dynamics of your ear and optimizing sound delivery, and the tap gestures seem to be able to differentiate when I am gesturing versus adjusting fit. The only minor quarrel I have is that over the course of about 20 hours of listening, I have had 4 or 5 brief bluetooth glitches on Spotify. Nothing major, less than 2 seconds each, but a minor annoyance.All that said, these are my new daily go-tos and I will be spreading the good word far and wide.","Reviewed in the United States February 12, 2024",AG3PKN6CDPV3AANM4OUQJYACLOKQ,1,35,Color: Black,JBL Live Pro 2,0.260893722943723,0.573938528138528,Positive
R1TO6XEYG3PL57,B09V9P5Q6W,5.0 out of 5 stars Such An Amazing Product from JBL!!!,Sherry G McKinney,5,"I am an avid music fan and appreciate good sound. I wear buds at work 5 days a week for around 8 hours a day. I was pleased with my Beats Studio Buds, they are great, but battery really sucks. I started searching for a replacement with the same quality and much better battery life when I came across these. I’m not the type of person that will drop $250 on the new AirPods Pro 2nd gen because they’re supposedly the best and are super popular. I believe in “bang for your buck” and audiophile like sound without having to shell out too much. Now it takes a lot to impress me, I’m a dj and know what premium audio is. JBL makes great stuff and have been around for 75 years. I compared all the features and they are so similar to the AirPods Pro. Got them @ a steal of $99.99 on sale, normally $149.99! Lemme say everything about these buds is fantastic! The fit/feel is tight and comfortable and comes without fear of them falling out. The sexy blue finish is so appealing and total “eye candy.” The battery is wonderful @ 40 hours total including case with 10 hours in the buds alone! JBL is a brand that’s well known for their innovation and reliability as these earbuds are a clear representation of that. They are built solid, have terrific call quality and the noise cancellation is the best I’ve ever heard in a pair of earbuds. The best part about the Live Pro 2’s is of course the stellar sound that features powerful rich, hard-hitting, and deep bass notes combined with perfectly balanced crystal-clear highs + mids. The 11 mm drivers really shine and the detail comes to life without distortion, for the frequencies don’t overpower each other. You can pump up the volume and not worry about blowing them. I tried out the app EQ but my problem is that you can only use it with both buds in as well as not having enough presets. I listen to primarily EDM and have to customize to my liking because I prefer a lot of bass, “warm” mids, and “crispy” highs. I don’t prefer to listen to music flat. It would be nice to have the EDM presets such as “dance” and “electronic” available. I found that the “jazz” setting is pretty good. Other than that these absolutely rock and can go head to head with the AirPods Pro 2nd gen. They contain the exact same size of drivers. Maybe they’re aren’t as good, but indefinitely very close. Do yourself a favor, save some $$$ and get these Live Pro 2’s!","Reviewed in the United States January 7, 2024",AEFYW3RIBSE4NB3VQPUQS2YDX2UA,1,21,Color: Blue,JBL Live Pro 2,0.29320399545809384,0.536315733446881,Positive
R3MR7L2QDVM3HC,B09V9P5Q6W,4.0 out of 5 stars Overall Very Good,T. Towe,4,"EDIT: I've been using these for about 2 weeks now, 2-5 hours every weekday at work, primarily for cell phone call, calls on the Microsoft Teams app on my phone, and Teams on my PC (with a couple of Zoom calls thrown in). - The multipoint is flawless. I have yet to actually need to force the earbuds to switch devices (I think you do this with a single tap followed immediately by a long press on the right earbud, but I'm not sure), they just do it automatically. I can actually be on a Teams call on my PC, transfer the call to the Teams app on my phone, and the earbuds just switch: perfect. - When I'm on a call (two-way communication through the earbuds, not just one-way music) they use about 40% of the battery in 2 hours. This disappoints me a little, but reality is I'm never on the earbuds more than 3 hours straight, and they charge up so quickly when I put them in the case that it's just not an issue.ORIGINAL: I bought these specifically for office work: I wanted a pair of earbuds with multipoint (Teams and Zoom on a Windows PC and an Android phone, as well as phone calls), long battery life, good microphones, and comfortable. These fit the bill. - Clear and understandable microphone - Very good battery life: I've seen about 10% battery usage from 1hr of music playback at about 40% volume with ANC on, and about 15% from about 1hr on a phone call. They are also supposed to get 4 hours of playback from just 15 minutes of charging (pretty tough to test this), so if I run the earbud batteries low I can power them up again fast enough to be useful. - So far pretty seamless switching between my phone and laptop, but I've mostly left them in the case until I need them, so I haven't done enough testing of this feature - Very light and comfortable with minimal protrusion into my ear canal. At this point, I've worn them for up to about 3 hours straight with no issues. - The case is pretty small, very portable and pocketable.If you're primary usage is multiple hours of calls per day from 2 devices, just get these, you'll be pretty happy.For more general use: - Crystal clear sound, but little bass out-of-the-box. However, the equalizer in the JBL app is excellent: it starts with 10 bands (+/-6db) and lets you add, subtract and move bands around in frequency seeming however you want. And again, crystal clear: you can pump the bass significantly and it sounds very good. This is the best equalizer (both impact on sound quality and flexibility) of any bluetooth earbud app I have used. - The ANC is very good, if you get a very good seal with the eartips. - Ambient mode is good, but I never feel like ambient mode is good enough to carry on a normal conversation while I'm wearing both earbuds. - ""Hear-through"" mode drops the volume as well as turning on some version of the ambient mode; doesn't do much for me. - Auto-play/pause of the music when you remove an earbud from your ear and replace it in your ear is not so robust, it works maybe 75% of the time: sometimes it doesn't pause the music when I pull an earbud out of my ear, sometimes it doesn't restart the music when I reinsert the earbud. - These earbuds don't quite go deep enough in my ear canals to provide the very good ANC, or a very secure fit, and if I listen to music I will need to adjust them periodically (multiple times per hour) to keep the tips really ""aimed"" into my ear canals and preserve the audio quality. For my particular ears, I need 1-2mm deeper protrusion; if a little shallower works well for you, you might fall in love with the audio quality and ANC.Why these aren't 5 star for me: - Fundamentally, the not-quite deep enough fit, so they don't seal well enough and not move for extended periods. This is the big thing for me, but there are a few other nits. - In the app, you need to add ANC to the touch controls (so you can cycle through ANC, Ambient mode, and Hear-Through mode). The earbuds or the app sometimes seem to forget this has been enabled and then I don't have ANC, until I go back into the app and re-enable it. I haven't seen any consistency on this yet. - Touch controls are limited: three groups of controls are available (volume control, playback control, or ANC/Ambient control) and you can choose in the app to put one group of controls on each earbud, so you have to choose which group of controls you will not have.If these fit my ears just a little better, they would be my #1 pair of earbuds, period; without that, they are #1 for calls. My Sony WF-C500s are still #1 for extended music sessions, and these JBLs are kind of tied with my Wyze Buds Pros for #1 for music with ANC.","Reviewed in the United States December 4, 2022",AE2WC2L45TPTKJGSLRQWCDLYEDJQ,1,91,Color: Black,JBL Live Pro 2,0.24338057445200295,0.5070049130763417,Positive
R1QXL2G2R3SICY,B09V9P5Q6W,5.0 out of 5 stars Amazing earbuds *better than airpod pro IMO*,Gabe,5,"Amazing sound with high quality low-high drivers on these JBL's. Noise cancelling is best in class for these earbuds, and the pass-through mode for still hearing conversation with them in works very well.They last FOREVER. I work 12 hour shifts and can easily get through a shift with the bud in my right ear all day. Over my hour lunch break I put it back in the case and that charge is enough to get me through an entire day with no interruptions. In my experience the advertised 40 total hours of listening with the charging case is very accurate. I measured it at 38.5 hours with the volume set to about 80-85%. I'm sure you could easily get 40+ hours if using them at 50% volume.The charging case is great, feels very high quality. Charges wirelessly on a charging pad or with USBC input. Charges very quickly, roughly 1.5-2 hours for a full charge if you are charging them with a low volt charger as you are supposed to as not to damage the internal battery.*NOTE* please people, don't charge any of your earbuds of any brand with a 100 watt fast charger, you will damage the battery over time I promise.The JBL app is one of the best earbud companion apps I've used. It blows the BEATS app out of the water and is much better than the majority of its competition. You can change EQ, noise cancelling, and touch control programming quickly and easily.Speaking of touch controls, they are located on the stem of each bud and work very reliably in my experience. 1 tap for pause, 2 taps for skip ahead, 1 tap hold for voice assistant. 2 taps then hold on the 2nd tap for pairing mode. Haven't had any issues with accidental touches over the last 6+ months of using them every day.The sound profile is rich and deep, with these high quality drivers after Harmon kardon joined with JBL, they are much more well rounded than anything else in the 150 dollar range. Highs are crisp and satisfying and lows have a great little rumble without muddling the mids. Soundstage isnt too open like you get with some of the partial In ear designs but doesn't feel closed off and stuffy either. My father in law was an audio engineer in Hollywood for 40 years and worked for almost every major band under the sun as well as the Jimmy Kimmel show for many years, and when he tried these out on our last visit he was genuinely impressed. He is normally a Sony or Bose guy but expressed interest in buying a pair of these for around the house.As far as fitment goes, I go with the middle sized silicone tips and they work great for me. There are small, medium and large tips that come in the package. They are more comfortable than the beats I have and far more comfortable than my airpods pro. I can use them for 12 hours straight without ear fatigue. They are ported enough where they don't feel stuffy in my ears and don't make my ears itchy like most other buds do after only a couple of hours.Overall, I highly recommend these earbuds from JBL. They are the best value for money in this price range--bar none. I would take these all day everyday over my airpods pro and that's saying something as those are no slouch either. If you are on the fence about these, I'd advise you to just buy them and see for yourself. As someone who uses earbuds for 12 hours a day, 48 hours a week, these are my go-to buds and I've tried at least 20 other models from all the major brands.","Reviewed in the United States July 19, 2023",AE3Z2WDE3L4HJQATPE3GWDNQGF3A,1,123,Color: Black,JBL Live Pro 2,0.2465227272727273,0.5122248677248677,Positive
RD6R0SI64RNZS,B09V9P5Q6W,5.0 out of 5 stars Fantastic earbuds and value,waloody88,5,"I wanted to give these a score of 4.5, but that wasn't an option. I liked everything except the controls. I bought it at $100, but it is a good value even for $150I will compare this to Edifier TWS1 Pro and CA Melomania 1+ which I used with Google pixel 4a 5GSetup:Live 2 pro is the best. It supports Google fast pair unlike the other 2. Melomania supports 5.0 Bluetooth with a right earbud as main so you can initiate a connection with either both side or right, but not left alone. You can switch easily from right only connection to left only, but not left to right. Edifier TWS1 Pro had bt 5.2 with aptx adaptive so it was easy to switch and connect.App support: melomania as a decent app, but no as good as JBL's. Edifier TWS1 Pro had no app support.Connection quality: the JBL has a reliable connection with a few cuts that last 2 seconds( I did most of my testing on music mode). It didn't have aptx so I used AAC. AAC had a smoother sound with wider soundstage. SBC had harsher sound that felt compressed. Edifier TWS1 Pro had no cuts at at all thanks to aptx adaptive. Melomania had ACC and standard Aptx and BT 5.0 unlike BT 5.2 on the other two. It had many connections issues and cuts. It tends to restart when a connection is lost while playing music and you end up hearing a startup voice prompt and the volume resets to %50. Very irritating.Battery life: that all features about 10hr + 30hr battery life in theory, but only JBL can come close to these numbers. The TWS1 Pro doesn't always attach properly to the case to charge and remain connected draining battery when that happens. Melomania is even worse because on top of this it an earbuds can connect to your phone sometimes even while charging so it had the worst battery life. I didn't like the high performance mode of Melomania because it sounded worse and drained more battery. I used the regular mode.Wireless charging: only JBL has it but I don't have a charging pad to try itANC and Transparency modes: only JBL has it and the are both good but not the best in class.Case: TWS1 Pro has the thickest case. JBL's case is slightly smaller. Melomania had the smallest case. TWS1 Pro had only one LED light to indicate battery level of the case. Melomania had 5 LEDs for the case. Jbl had 3 leds for the case and 2 leds for ear earbud (7 leds in the case). That is so cool.Earbuds: TWS1 pro has bulky earbuds, but the touch area was not flat and it made touch controls easy to miss despite the responsive touch response. JBL has responsive touch controls, but the small surface area of the touch controls makes using touch controls a nightmare. Melomania had small earbuds that had responsive physical buttons.Comfort: all 3 were comfortable for me.Volume: Edifier TWS1 Pro had the lowest volume followed by Melomania. All of them were loud. JBL wasn't far behind Melomania.Sound quality: melomania had some weird magic. It sounded the best. It had great tuning and probably the best driver response time. It was warmer in a nice and natural way and it was the most detailed especially in bass. A V-shape tuning. However, it has the narrowist soundstage. JBL had a sound profile that is a bass boosted version of the Harman Target. It has a great bass. It was the smoothest sounding and it has the widest soundstage. TTWS1 lacked subbass and it had the harshest treble, but the least detailed. None of the 3 had an excellent mid but JBL had the mids of the 3 while Tws1 pro had the worst mids and weaks vocal details. In conclusion, the details of the driver carried the melomania, but JBL was the most balanced, smoothest and had the widest soundstage.Equalizer: TWS1 pro had no app. Melomania had a decent 5 band EQ but the frequencies were not properly labeled. JBL had the best EQ of all earbuds. It is a full featured EQ that labels the frequencies. I was able to make a custom EQ to make the sound even smoother even though JBL was already the most balanced of the 3.Autopause: only JBL has it.Sidetone: only JBL has that.Multipoint connection: only JBL has it. I could connect 2 devices at the same time (Android and windows), but I couldn't for some reason get both devices to seemlessly switch audio without completely disabling the other. That's weird and could be a bug.Earbuds controls: these is the area that made me want to deduct 0.5 star from my score for JBL. It has controls for everything, but you have to choose from 3 button presets that you can't manually edit for each earbud (playback, volume, ANC and Transparency). This is ridiculous. I can't have volume and playback on the same earbud in mono mode. Also I had to give up ANC preset completely because I set volume for left and playback on right. Tws1 had the best button preset for mono and stereo (despite not having ANC). Melomania had the same controls till they decided to remove volume control from mono mode in a firmware 😑Latency: tws1 pro had the lowest latency thanks to Aptx adaptive. Melomania had an average latency. JBL had the worst latency on music mode (default preset). On video mode it has a low latency that is comparable to Aptx adaptive in Tws1 pro. Normal mode didn't lower latency that much from music mode, but it made sound quality noticably worse than music mode.I had to return Melomania 1+ because of all the connection issues and it stopped working. I am still keeping the Edifier as a backup earbuds despite the not so great sound and charging issues.

R30CUSW6PS3UPQ,B09V9P5Q6W,5.0 out of 5 stars Great sound which translates to great value,Parnone,5,"I bought these to replace a set of Airpods of which the battery life was quickly becoming abysmal. The purpose of the headphones was convenience. They are kept on the table beside my chair in the living room. They are easy to get to when I want to listen to something like a youtube video and not have wires so I'm not tethered to my device if I need to get up to the let the dog out. The best thing about the airpods is they were made so they don't plug into my ear canal. Most ear buds just work their way out of my ear canals so not having that issue was a major plus. Since they are dying I decided to see what else would fill that role that would have better battery life. I looked for ratings and advice on the Internet. These JBLs seemed to be what I needed for the same price as a new set of basic Airpods. The only negative was they have tips that fit into ear canals. Since the rest of the ear bud looked like it would sit in the outer ear almost like the Airpods I decided to risk it. I had to put the smallest tips on them to get them in my ear canals. The left one slowly works it's way out over time unless I really push it in deep but it hasn't been a big issue. They are very comfortable. The sound quality is very nice. Being able to customize the EQ in the app was really great so I could tailor the sound to my liking. These aren't audiophile quality but I would hope that wouldn't be expected at this price point. They pair up with my Ipad immediately every time. I have done any extended listening but the battery life has been great. It's very convenient to be able to put the case on a charging pad instead of having to plug it in. The noise cancellation works pretty good in my opinion. I don't have anything else with noise cancelling to compare it to. I do find it funny that it blocks most of the sound from the tv but when my wife talks to me I can hear her at a significantly reduced level but still fairly clearly. Noise cancellation isn't important to me so I leave it off almost all the time in favor of increased battery life. The most important thing I can say is if I was in the market to buy another set of wireless ear buds, I'd buy these again with no hesitation as long as the reason I was looking for another set wasn't because these stopped working in a short period of time.","Reviewed in the United States July 17, 2023",AFA2QYDJOWIYGY6B6URKDUSOZ46Q,1,15,Color: Blue,JBL Live Pro 2,0.3001845376845377,0.5460567210567211,Positive

I literally purchased this model because of this feature. You may experience a slight latency in sound and it is a little annoying. If this annoys you, install the JBL app and switch your earbuds to VIDEO MODE. This mode is for video streamers. AUDIO MODE gives better sound quality but with a latency.

Great build and sound quality, easy to use and pretty complete app, very comfortable fit, great battery life, etc. The only issue I ran into, something that's been mentioned in several reviews, sound periodically and randomly cuts out (every 15-30 mins or so). It's as if they loose connection, get unsynced from the phone and then resynced back up with it a couple of seconds later. I don't wanna live with that so I'm gonna be sending them back, unfortunately. JBL you've got some fixing to do there.Edit: After resetting and then disabling a few settings it doesn't seem to happen nearly as frequently.

R3BSO2Z292CY93,B09V9P5Q6W,3.0 out of 5 stars Most important feature doesn't meet expectations,Dakota,3,"I've had these for over a year now and use them nearly everyday at work. Overall, I would not recommend these earbuds and I'll be looking to replace them soon. The main reason is simple: they do not stay in my ears.I cannot use them at the gym, while performing chores, or any physical activity. I've put up with them because I work at a desk for most of my day. Even so, while near motionless at my desk I am constantly adjusting them and pushing them back into my ears. I have tried all three insert sizes without luck.My girlfriend likes to sleep with her $40 noise cancelling earbuds in. I couldn't believe they stayed in her ear all night until I tried them on. Her cheap pink earbuds created such a seal that when I took them off it was like uncorking a bottle of wine.This may seem like a small issue, but it cascades into more issues. Noise cancelling is useless when the earbuds are constantly half falling out of your ears. I get more noise cancellation out of my wired earbuds because they actually form a seal in my ear. I am also unintentionally changing modes and pausing music by hitting the function buttons when pressing them back into place. Speaking of, there is a noticeable delay when switching modes. It's a small complaint, but still annoying enough that I usually take the earbuds out rather than switch modes when someone approaches me.My favorite thing about these is the battery life. With everything fully charged I can get through the better half of the work week while using them all day everyday. My recommendation would be purchase these if your largest concern is battery life as that comes in handy when traveling. Other than that I'm fairly certain you can get more for less by shopping elsewhere.","Reviewed in the United States June 4, 2024",AGMIVRBBWWBVEGJ43NYWUL4ZN56A,1,0,Color: Black,JBL Live Pro 2,0.030483405483405484,0.39282106782106785,Neutral

R3GHZWZVCHJ6WS,B09V9P5Q6W,5.0 out of 5 stars 2019 Airpod Pros vs. 2022 JBL Live Pro2,Quick Reviews,5,"tldr; JBL wins all categories except for ANC, slightly wonky pause/play, and lag (depending on your device).Airpod Pros 2019: I was gifted the Airpod Pros by my brother for use with my iPhone. I started to use it with my Windows 10 laptop and iPhone. Connecting to Windows is cumbersome but doable. At one point, I had to tweak the windows registry to get it to recognize the AirPods. Windows 11 changed the Bluetooth audio stack to support AAC and what that means is if there's no audio being played through the AirPods for about 5-10 seconds then it shuts off completely and takes another 5-10 seconds to turn back on (to save battery I heard). This just produces an initial audio start up lag. Think 1970's Kung-Fu lip-dubbing.Apple AirPods Pro 2:- Battery life is at 4 hours with ANC, 4.5 with ANC off (Each firmware update had made the ANC worst. Source: Reddit Posts)- Audio is neutral all around to please most consumers but its nothing exciting. Bass is definitely lacking.- Bluetooth 5.0, Apple H1, and lightning port connectionJBL Live Pro2:- Multi-connections (Maximum of 2 devices). I have my iPhone and Windows 10 laptop and they jump back and forth seamlessly.- If the earbuds have nothing in range to connect to them it auto defaults to ""Discovery Mode"". Pretty convenient.- 8-10 Hours playback easily (These are my EDCs and I have been using them for about 4 months now).- Touch controls! Yes! All your basic audio, ANC, and Alexa/Siri/Google. No volume but I'm completely fine with that for this price range.- ANC has AI auto-adjusting environment setting via app (App is on the GooglePlay and AppStore). It is slightly weaker than my AirPods. I tested by snapping my fingers on each earbud.- Earbuds do offer pause/play when removing them from your ears but its slightly slower vs. AirPods. The pause/play uses vibration more than the motion when I'm placing the earbuds back into your ears. Putting it in my pockets can cause audio to resume. ***Be aware of this***- Low profile LED lights on each earbud to give you light indicators of your battery, BT connectivity, and if audio is paused or playing.- App offers more audio fine tuning controls via app compared to AppleConclusion:It uses a USB-C charging case and its form factor is smaller than the AirPod Pros. It offers almost triple the battery life per session and double the features of the AirPod Pros. It does have a bit of an audio lag on my iPhone and laptops but so did my other non-Apple Bluetooth earbuds.Bonus: This review is completely subjective. This is the first audio product where I don't feel discomfort after my usual 8-10 hour sessions. It destroys my AirPods and Anker (latter having the worst fit and comfortability) in every way. Fitting is S+ tier and I don't have that constant worry or feeling that my earbuds will fall off.These review has been edited on 9/17/22 and are my currently daily drivers for the past 4 months for my WFH role and leisure.","Reviewed in the United States May 27, 2022",AFJYLFDBAE4YXQ7TPWMTPV6A32DQ,1,85,Color: Black,JBL Live Pro 2,0.0806773088023088,0.3734126984126984,Neutral

I've had over-ear JBL headphones and the past and when it was time to replace my earbuds, felt confident that a JBL set would do the trick. While I love the sound and noise cancelling on these, I've just encountered too many problems along the way to justify what I spent on this set.PROS- Excellent, customizable sound. There's a JBL app (more on that in the CONS section) that allows you to adjust sound levels to suit your needs. I like extra bass and was able to fine-tune it to my liking.- Pretty good noise cancelling. Not perfect, but was definitely able to drown out the majority of stuff like gym noise, mower sounds, etc.- Long battery life and fast chargingCONS- The JBL app only detects my earbuds MAYBE 1 out of every 5-6 times I try to get into it. This has been a problem from the beginning and can be incredibly frustrating because the app is how you access the equalizer, improve noise cancellation, etc.- Mono mode is horribly hit and miss. Sometimes it works just putting one earbud in, sometimes it doesn't. Sometimes I have to put in BOTH earbuds and then put one back into the charging case. Sometimes it works for a while using just one earbud, and then the sound suddenly stops.- Reduced volume issues. I've only had these around 6-7 months and I've already noticed a pretty bad volume drop in the right earbud. I've cleaned them regularly and taken good care of them, but am already in a place where I'm probably going to have to find a new pair soon. I would have expected a pair of earbuds that costs north of $100 to last longer, especially since I've spent half that amount on earbuds in the past and gotten better life out of them.At this point I can't say I would recommend these, simply because there are bound to be options at a similar or lower price point that don't have the finicky quality issues that these seem to have.","Reviewed in the United States April 18, 2024",AFJXHVKY65UIXCDRXVJV3LG5SO3A,1,5,Color: Blue,JBL Live Pro 2,0.1275097917955061,0.5335156906585479,Neutral

R182V6ZTSGVSHT,B09V9P5Q6W,"4.0 out of 5 stars Decent Enough, and Good Value Too!",Ian R. Baranek,4,"Replaced my Anker Soundcore Liberty 3 Pro's with these and so far am pretty pleased.On the positive side: the battery life is a huge step up! Even with ANC toggled on, they pretty much last an entire shift at work with one charge. The charging case design is also a massive improvement; the buds snap well into place, the lid closes firmly and all around seems a lot more durable. Another huge point in their favor is stability. The round Soundcore buds would nearly fall out of my ears at the slightest jostling and required constant readjustment. These fit snugly the second I put them in and barely move from there, although I'll admit they do start to grate a bit after several hours of wearing them.As for my disappointments: I'd say the audio quality is a slight downgrade, potentially due to the lack of aptX support, but it's certainly serviceable. I'm also mildly annoyed with the app for lacking more robust customization in regards to the gesture controls. In my case, I'd prefer to map play/pause to the 2 second hold gesture and disable every other function, but unfortunately, that's not possible. Play/pause will always be mapped to single tap, and the 3 other gestures in the category cannot be individually disabled either. I've honestly gotten used to it and luckily the controls aren't quite as sensitive as I was worried they'd be, so not quite a deal breaker, just irritating. Another point about the app is there seems to be some latency when adjusting equalizer settings, like a noticeable delay before the sound is actually altered which struck me as odd. That being said, I did find the equalizer to be a bit more in-depth.Overall: so far, so good! I'll update with any future issues if need be.","Reviewed in the United States September 25, 2023",AELDQSBTWWQWHFPQ2CLYQZRH723A,1,7,Color: Black,JBL Live Pro 2,0.09073487488121637,0.5281992397846056,Neutral
R1PUBI0U34ANHS,B09V9P5Q6W,5.0 out of 5 stars A deaf old man's review,Jon,5,"I grew up on 60s and 70s Rock. 20 years in the Air Force might be the cause of 70% loss of hearing in my left ear and about 30% in the right. Just layin' that out for the sake of relativity.Right now I'm sitting in Old Rocker Heaven, listening to Blondie's Heart of Glass (Vocal + Instrumental Remix). I can hear EVERYTHING, for the first time in a very long time.My first reaction to these earbuds, pulling up Don't Bring Me Down (ELO), was as close to Oh Em Gee as this dude ever gets. The first two measures of that classic rock tune blew me away, and then everything else. The breakdown at about 2:30 was SO CLEAR AND CRISP that I can't even describe it, except to say I could hear every rumble of the drums and bass, the whole of every note clear as a bell.I haven't tried the app yet (the earbuds paired to my old Android phone in a snap) but I've got Rocket Player with a 10-band equalizer on my phone. I don't need much else but I guess I'll try the app at some point, just to see if it really deserves the 4.4 google play rating or not. The app's low number of permissions is definitely a plus.""Heart of Glass"" finished while I was writing, now testing them with a 17-track Beach Boys mix. Haven't heard the Boys sound like this for at least 30 years.I've always liked JBL (they go way back) but they have surely outdone themselves with these earbuds. I might buy another pair sometime soon (in a different color, have blue right now) just to have a backup. I will NEVER want to be without these earbuds as long as I have a fair amount of hearing left.","Reviewed in the United States November 27, 2023",AEQ7YFFIJ5CG5V4QDJFL23ECHS4Q,1,1,Color: Blue,JBL Live Pro 2,0.1405846560846561,0.373973544973545,Neutral
RREDY85TQQ1VC,B09V9P5Q6W,"5.0 out of 5 stars First impression: So far, the BEST true wireless earbuds I've tried!",Tony Snark,5,"For comparison, I have a pair of Beats Studio Buds and Sennheiser Momentum 2. Overall, these blow those out of the water! Especially considering the price. I guess I have sensitive nerves and a lot of earbuds get uncomfortable quickly due to the pressure. I find the Sennhesiers to be unbearable for more than an hour. The Beats buds are smaller and more comfortable but not quite as comfy as these. These sound better than the Beats. Tbh, I haven't used the Sennheisers in so long, I don't remmeber if they sound better, but these sound just fine, I don't feel like I'm missing out on anything. They certainly live up to my expectations from JBL and experience with their speakers over the years (I'm always satisfied).I bought these on impulse because they went on sale for half off, and at $75, I'm very happy with the purchase - they are absolutely worth it.What REALLY impresses me, is the app! Absolutely blows Beats' and Sennheiser's apps out of the water! JBL offers way more features and configurability than the competition! Smart and helpful features like ""Check my best fit"" that help you know for sure you have inserted the buds properly in your ears and power saving are nowhere to be found in those others' apps. They also give you the option to have voice feedback when you use the touch gestures (very nice because I always get confused what I'm doing with other earbuds with touch gestures) or turn them off if you are not a dummy like me, lol.Best of all, the voice awareness is THE BEST! On my Sennheisers, the feature is basically a lie. The Beats Buds let a bit more sound through, but I still could never hear people well enough over music, even at very low volume, so I'd still have to pause the music, making the feature useless.The JBL Headphones app lets you configure the awareness and you can set it pretty high. With these, I can hear someone perfectly over my music, even at a loud volume! I had lost hope in being able to do that, thinking I just had too much hearing loss to have a conversation over music or something. Finally, I know the feature just has to be implemented well like JBL has done.Lastly, I think the blue colorway looks very nice and the chromatic finish on the outer panel is sleek without looking cheap or cheesy.I highly recommend these earbuds, especially at their reduced price!","Reviewed in the United States December 20, 2022",AGC3AAQ4MVORRK3QWVIQ5ZM4LM4A,1,13,Color: Blue,JBL Live Pro 2,0.271612987012987,0.541868253968254,Positive
R3SF3OX4RUEMTO,B09V9P5Q6W,5.0 out of 5 stars Great earbuds for the workplace,F-man,5,"Sound quality: EXCELLENT when paired to a quality music source such as my Samsung Galaxy S23. The music I play through these drifts me away into a sea of bliss. These are not overly bassy so go with another if you like music that rumbles your ears. They have a good blend of high and low frequencies and have very good clarity.Comfort: These fit my ears just fine but the plastic housing part of the earbud presses against the inside of my ear canal so I can only listen to music for about an hour or two at a time. Because of this, I don't advise these to be used to fall asleep in.Hear through: My office (cubicle farm) has the occasional person coming up behind me and the occasional coworker looking to speak with me over the wall. This feature allows speech to come through while I listen to music and is in my opinion more important to have than noise cancellation. Generally, I can hear roughly 80% of the surroundings than if I were not to have these on.Noise cancellation: Very good. The music comes through very well when I transition from 'hear through' to NC. And the NC almost completely blocks out the commotion and white noise around me. It seems only 5-10% of the environmental sounds makes it into my ears which in my opinion is the sweet spot for how quiet I want things to be.In conclusion, I love these ear buds and I'm glad I picked them out over the 10s of others I researched prior to getting these.","Reviewed in the United States January 7, 2024",AGTXXD4FCGMNTA3CQOYNNSDVEETQ,1,0,Color: Black,JBL Live Pro 2,0.25913580246913576,0.534567901234568,Positive

RUDKVU0MOXBQZ,B09V9P5Q6W,5.0 out of 5 stars Fantastic ear buds - UPDATED,#NAME?,5,"I've tried several pairs of lower cost ear buds and have experienced low cost results. After doing a lot of research I chose the JBL Live Pro. It has exceeded expectations. First off the fitment is very good for a non custom earpiece, ideally a size between medium and large would be a better fit for me as the large tips are just a teeny bit too big and it takes some adjusting to get a good seal for the noise cancelling. But once they are set all is good to go.The sound is awesome, very clear and the bass is deep and rumbles - something I have not had in previous earbuds. Phone conversations are clear on both my side and the callers. The bluetooth connects quickly to my phone without having to open any apps or make adjustments.I have yet to run out of power, even after using them all day.The noise cancelling is very good. I wore these while mowing the lawn in place of my usual over the ear headset. The mower went from a roar to sounding like a toy, making it very easy to listen to music or a podcast. The smart ambient feature also works very well.The App is intuitive and easy to configure.Overall I am very pleased and anticipate using these for a long time.UPDATE May 2024 - I lost one of the silicon ear tips and was surprised to find that JBL does not offer replacements and you have to go with an aftermarket brand - so I am taking back one star. Tips wear out or get lost, why JBL doesn't have replacements is a mystery, especially at this price point. I found a memory foam set that actually performs better than the OE tips in terms of comfort and staying in place.","Reviewed in the United States November 10, 2023",AGWBEPMA7H33LZ5DJNH2TIYAEG7A,1,3,Color: Black,JBL Live Pro 2,0.295626503126503,0.5256944444444444,Positive

Pairs fast and has Bluetooth 5.0 so you can check your battery life and have access to low latency features.Case easily holds 3-4 full charges for the buds, and the case charges quickly and conveniently on a wireless pad. USB-C is nice as well.Only (and relatively significant) issue is how the contacts are designed for the earbuds themselves. The pogo pins are extremely prone to sticking if you get your earbuds even a bit sweaty. Sometimes, the pins will completely refuse to connect to the earbud, and while they are smart enough to turn off after a few minutes of non-use, they will not charge at all in this case (and subsequently refuse to turn on on the next use until the pins are reset). You may need pliers to ease out the stuck pins in these situations. However, this can be remedied by quickly wiping off your earbuds' stems after a run, and by swabbing the contacts themselves with a q-tip dipped in isopropyl alcohol once in a while.","Reviewed in the United States October 24, 2023",AF63WNMH3YSB6MP3K5CPNJUXVHKA,1,3,Color: Black,JBL Live Pro 2,0.25059523809523804,0.5542162698412697,Positive

RQD80RBG6E431,B09V9P5Q6W,5.0 out of 5 stars Almost perfect…,T. Baxter,5,"Been using these about 1.5 months now. I have had many a pair of wireless earbuds or headphones (at all price points) and these do exceed all of those in every category except one. The battery life is outstanding (all day podcast listener here) the charging case (super fast) and size of it is perfect (fits in my pocket) , they feel comfortable even while sleeping in them (I am a heavy user), and they come with multiple sizes of the rubber pieces that go in your ear and you won’t lose them because they stay on the buds when you aren’t wearing them unlike my last pair. The only downside I have found is they don’t stay in my ears really well. I have tried all sizes of the rubber pieces that fit in the ear and get my best fit with different sizes in each ear, but they still fall out pretty easily. They fall out mostly when I tilt my head forward or bend over, I have to be very careful while doing dishes or using the restroom (afraid water will ruin them). Sometimes just moving different facial muscles pushes one out causing me to have to readjust one frequently. As frustrating as it is having to reinsert or readjust them frequently I would still recommend these. Might not work great for runners or cross fitter’s but I am managing fine with hiking in the mountains and gardening for hours. I mostly listen to podcasts and watch YouTube with them so sound quality was second in importance to me over battery life. That being said, they sound great with music and phone calls too. I really Like the noise canceling feature, but don’t know why one needs the talk thru feature when you could just pause it, and I wish it had volume controls on the buds but not a big deal. A nice feature is when one slips out of position it automatically pauses my content and starts it back up when reinserted. This is my second JBL product, first was a shower speaker which I also love.

Comparing the Samsung buds to the JBL, the JBL keeps up pretty well the only downside seems to be that with the Samsung buds you can use all functions on both buds whereas on the JBL you have to choose different things for each side they don't particularly care for that idea. The other downside for the JBL is trying to adjust the volume from the buds when you're on a phone call, I don't believe you can whereas the Samsung buds you can. Now when it comes to battery life the JBL has the Samsung beat hands down. With ambient on all day the JBL holds up pretty darn good, as the Samsung buds don't do very well at all.

Even though I've had Apple's AirPods since all my devices are Apple products, the only 'plus' they have is seamless synchronization with Apple devices. However, I find them quite expensive for what they offer. In contrast, these headphones have significantly better features and sound. The bass is incredible, and the noise cancellation is noteworthy. The touch controls work wonderfully, and the microphone is crystal clear.Initially, during the first week, I had issues with the fit as the app suggested my best 'fit' was MEDIUM. However, I felt the earbuds gradually loosening, so I decided to try SMALL, and now they fit perfectly. So, don't rely on the app 100%. Another rare issue is that sometimes, after 1 to 1.5 hours of listening, the music pauses for half a second and then resumes. After this, it doesn't happen again. I looked online, and a solution could be disabling the 'smart audio' option in the app. So far, it has worked for me, and hopefully, it won't happen again.As for the rest, the battery lasts more than a week. I rarely charge these headphones, and I use them for everything.

R7X7RGP05G8O2,B09V9P5Q6W,"3.0 out of 5 stars Calls are really quiet, kinda sucks",Alex Founders,3,"I'm on the phone all day for work. I look for a few basic things in a headset or earbuds:- The ability to use either earbud for calls- The ability to mute my mic via the earbud- Sound quality both for me and for the person I'm talking toWith these, I can use either one, which is great. Mute requires me to press for 2 seconds, which isn't convenient when I need to mute quickly or unmute quickly to respond on a call. Sound quality for the people on the other end seems to be fine... However, sound quality on my end is garbage when I'm on a call. It's too quiet. It's fine when I play music and is plenty loud, but calls are really quiet.I called support and they told me to turn on ANC. That didn't help, and they didn't have a solution for me. Searching online, other people have had the same problem. They need to increase the volume range by about double to make this a decent product. It can probably be done in software. I asked the person to put in a feature request when I chatted with support, but I don't think she did it. JBL, please fix this with a software update. I'm on an android phone, and during a call the call volume is set to max (in fact, all of the different volumes are set to max). I tried changing EQ settings, and same problem. If I listen to music, it's fine. It's only on calls and meetings (slack, teams, etc).Also, a setting that would provide an immediate mic mute/unmute would be great. This isn't configurable in the app. Holding it down for 2 seconds is ridiculous.Edit: on android, if you click on the volume button on the side of the phone and the click the 3 dots under the volume slider that appears on the screen... Turn the call volume from max down to zero, release, and then turn back to max. This seems to have increased the call volume significantly. It's still quieter than all of my other headsets, but it's actually fairly usable now. The 2 second mute sucks though. I increased my rating from 2 stars to 3.","Reviewed in the United States July 18, 2023",AH6525CTYP6GUBX37UVDTSJGIZWQ,1,3,Color: Black,JBL Live Pro 2,0.16362007168458778,0.42105734767025094,Neutral

There are better earbuds out there that do a better job for 1/3 the price (Tozo NC 2.)

The sound quality is amazing with deep, smooth bass that doesn't overpower the mids or highs, just an overall great balance.Battery life is very long as advertised. I'll wear these for hours while working in the yard with plenty of battery to spare......and they're quite comfortable too.The noise cancelling is very good but not as great as the AirPod Pros (1st Gen). You'll still hear your lawn mower/hedge trimmer/leaf blower/vacuum to some extent but your music will still come through very clear (just turn up the volume! LOL). The Ambient Aware setting though is outstanding. There really isn't a noticeable dropoff in sound quality and the ambient sound coming in sounds very natural. This is very useful when driving with the fam......I can hear my music quite well while still being able to hear someone talking to me. Other brands I've used, like Galaxy Buds, Taotronics, Tozo NC2 (also a great product) , Bose and AirPod Pros (1st Gen), the sound passing through is overly hissy and the quality isn't that great and drowns out the music somewhat.The range is adequate, about average with all other brands, about 50-75 feet indoors (defending on obstructions) and 40 feet outside (with few obstructions). Nothing will beat the AirPod Pros' range, not for $100. Still, this is not a concern but it would make the product better if the range could be improved.Lastly, I love the customizability of the gestures for these JBL's. Of the aforementioned brands, these sound the best. You can set up each stick for a variety of functions, including volume up/down. Since I always have my device nearby I leave the left side to toggle between the different listening modes and the right stick to control music playback functions.I'm very satisfied with this product.

The EQ in the app is absolutely amazing and lets you have complete control over the sound plus the transparency mode and noise canceling are seriously up there with $200 ANC buds; not to mention the battery life is insanely good. Although the mids get a bit lost and the instruments can get a bit muddy at high volumes (at low to mid volume the instrument separation is great depending on your EQ settings), the overall sound is unbeatable especially if you like a nice sub bass that isn’t too rumbly. Anyways my only complaint is that I may end up having to return them simply because they are a bit too large for my small ears so they hurt after about 15-20 minutes of wearing, either way I didn’t let this fact change my 5 star review because it’s not the buds fault; it’s more my bodies fault and the buds are awesome.","Reviewed in the United States October 31, 2023",AE3G6VS5QJYLHIR265ID4BJYLSEQ,1,5,Color: Silver,JBL Live Pro 2,0.2515167548500882,0.5608289241622576,Positive

As soon as I put them on, I noticed how potent the noice cancellation feature was! I wasn't playing any music, yet the conversation around me was completely muffled. I'd say these are perfect for crowded or public places as well. I also appreciate the ambient awareness feature since sometimes I need to be alert. I've been on the search for amazing sounding, noise cancelling earbuds for a few months now. I had the first Google Buds and even though they were a pain in the butt, the sound quality was beyond amazing on those. These JBL are the closest things I've found to that superb sound! I want to hear the bass, every hit on those drums, the backup singing, everything! I take these wherever I go now. On the JBL app, you can customize your Ambient Sound Control, gestures, voice assistant (mine is Google), etc. As for the fit, I know I have weird ear canals so the small size did it for me. The left one slips out when I move my jaw too much but I made peace with my natural odd ear. I have a thing with having my devices below 50% battery life so I plug the JBL case as soon as it hits 60% and that alone lasts for two full days, keep in mind that I wear them about 4 hours on days that I work. On my days off, I wear them 6 - 8 hours and the battery life still makes it to the next day without going below 50%. They're comfortable, too. My ears haven't ached at all.

R2D5B4AMKEPI4P,B09V9P5Q6W,4.0 out of 5 stars JBL understand nice bass & good noise canceling.,Owl with a Tie,4,"JBL understands nice sounding bass better than other companies. I did have to EQ to unbury the vocal fundamental 150 - 500hz (boosted this +2db). The EQ controls in the app allow to EQ pretty specifically. Now, this EQ change is dependent on your ear canal & ear cup size — for me the vocal fundamental was buried. I have to use the large cups. JBL & other companies should make curves for different cup sizes, as their “vocal” preset EQ boosted the nasal and harsh frequencies of vocals. They should contract a professional music mixer for these EQ curve presets. They should do the same for movie EQ curves. Aside from out of the box EQ, JBL products are capable of producing warm bass, and smooth mids and highs — I didn’t really touch the mid & high frequencies besides the soft slope falling from the vocal fundamental boost. Now that the ANC is good and doesn’t cut out giant chunks of frequencies from the music is very awesome — thanks for figuring that out.

R1JWJ95BYVWRD0,B0BZK2Z2TC,"5.0 out of 5 stars An alternative to AirPod Pros? Yes, but with a slight lower quality difference. Worth it? Yes",Matthew Martínez,5,"I compared these beats with AirPod pros. Both are Apple products.The beats have a smaller range of volume, the lowest volume is pretty loud for the “lowest volume”. Each level for volume going up is minimal compared to the AirPods. (At around 1/3 of the volume they match volume. AirPods get a lot quieter and ALOT louder, I’d say 10% louder) The beats are loud enough for me I leave it at 3/4 of volume.Noise cancellation is really good, some noise filters through in loud environments but it’s enough when you’re at the gym and busy places. I experienced noise filtering through when I was in a car with music blasting. So I’d rate the noise cancellation pretty high.Pass through, pass through is good. I’d recommend not having the pass through when there’s lots of noise cause it’s good and personally it can get loud. When there’s a sudden loud noise the earbuds make the same loud noise and it could hurt your ears if you have sensitive hearing.Cons, when in loud environments if you are on a call the earbuds filter out the noise, and when you speak it filters your voice a bit too which makes it hard for the other person on the other end to hear you. Also the bit about the loud noise with the pass through and sensitive ears is a con for me.Battery life is really good, lasts me my work day and a bit more, I’m sure like all batteries that would go down after use but hasn’t happened to me yet I’ve had it for 2 months now.Bluetooth, the Bluetooth is pretty strong. You could probably still have a connection a few rooms away in a house before the connection begins to fail. Unlike AirPods when you remove the bud from an ear whatever is playing will not pause unless YOU pause it. This means it’s constantly connected, when you are within the Bluetooth radius of course. I’ve lost a bud twice but this actually helped me find it, so that’s a plus. And with these beats you cannot connect another pair to your phone like you can with AirPods. So it’s only on pair of beats at a time.I really like the earbuds and I think they are well worth the price, to me they are a barely lesser version of AirPod pros. I’m considering getting the studio pro’s over the AirPod max after this experience.Update 4 months later- The battery life is still very strong, I have had some issues with them disconnecting and reconnecting to my phone and I believe it’s because when I got my Apple Watch, it must be Confusing the connection between my phone and the watch. Yes, it can be annoying but to me, it’s still worth it. All really need to do is reconnect with my phone. I don’t think AirPods Will have this problem. But I’m not sure. There was one day where the noise cancellation on my right earbud stopped working, but it’s because I didn’t have enough battery so I had to charge it after that I had no issues.","Reviewed in the United States March 12, 2024",AFPNLCKHE6UN5JN6M77MOHLXXGGA,1,57,Color: IvoryStyle: Studio Buds +Set: Without AppleCare+,Beats Studio Buds+,0.11770317460317459,0.5727809523809525,Neutral
R2BD35HL2C6JSK,B0BZK2Z2TC,5.0 out of 5 stars Read this Review (I'll tell you why I settled on these after researching for months!),Tuck VB,5,"You're probably like me, dragging your feet for months, researching and researching for hours trying to compare brand names (Bose, or JBL? Sennheiser, or Apple?). I finally settled on these, and here's why:1) I didn't want airpods. You probably also don't want airpods (if you're even reading this review). Not because of the quality, but because ""everyone has airpods"" and they're ""airpod people"" (sorry to all the airpod people, including my sister). I wanted to be different (hopefully no shame there?).2) My top priority was phone calls with my earbuds (make sure, even if you don't end up with these earbuds, that you determine your priorities, -clearly-). These earbuds have some of the best ""in ear"" calling I've seen (next to airpods).3) I wanted something low profile (also why I didn't want airpods with the ""stem""). These are very sleek, and don't look flashy in the ear. They're also not very cumbersome, and fit very snuggly. Very light, but durable - great design, even better build quality.4) Not a huge selling factor for me personally, but if you want noise cancellation, this is your stop. I just used these this morning on the train coming into Boston, sitting next to the door leading out of the coach, and was astonished with how adaptive it was to specifically tuning out the rattling of the train. These earbuds will adapt to the environments around them!5) The battery life is fantastic. Keep in mind, if you're in a loud area with the noise cancelling on, and it's working harder, you're going to blow through your battery faster - even that considered, I was still really impressed with the battery life!6) This is clearly designed to work seamlessly with Apple products. Pairing was a breeze, and the connectivity is strong. Beats and Apple had a beautiful handshake with this product, and it shows.7) Lastly, the sound quality. This is unmatched with anything I've used prior. Has very clear audio, and a great range of tone. The bass is powerful, while balancing defined treble tones.A couple things to consider:-These don't have wireless charging (unlike my other gadgets). I need to plug them into USB-C to charge. Might not be a big deal for you, but this is a drawback on my radar.-Get a protective case! The existing charging case is well built, and sturdy - but if you're like me, and you put your phone in a protective case, do the same for your earbuds. The case I got was drop proof, and didn't add much to the size (it doesn't take up much space in my pocket). It was $10 for peace of mind. Get an airtag too while you're at it!Overall, would recommend!","Reviewed in the United States January 2, 2024",AFYYCTAQAUEWFDXYF7BHMXS66TJQ,1,188,Color: Black/GoldStyle: Studio Buds +Set: Without AppleCare+,Beats Studio Buds+,0.20270833333333332,0.48159722222222223,Positive

R13FS9E750HR39,B0BZK2Z2TC,4.0 out of 5 stars Great for Daily Use,IT Guy,4,"The media could not be loaded. Quick OverviewI bought these headphones to replace some other earbuds that were beginning to have issues and so far I have really enjoyed these headphones. Since these earbuds are made with Apple in mind, they have easy pairing just like Airpods. They also integrate with Siri to read your texts and notifications, etc. and give you a chance to respond which is a great feature I missed when using another brand. My only complaint at the moment is really just a minor inconvenience - because of the low profile of the earbuds they are harder to grab out of the case since only a few millimeters of the earbuds are sticking out to grab. If you have nails or bigger fingers you might find it annoying to grab out of the case.One of my favorite things about these earbuds is the fact that they have actual physical buttons, NOT have touch buttons. I wear hoodies and it’s so annoying when it brushes a touch button and pauses my music or turns noise cancelling on or off.Crisp and Clear Sound Quality:The sound quality is impressive across various genres of music. The earbuds deliver a well-balanced sound signature with clear vocals, detailed instrument separation, and a mostly satisfying bass response. The highs are crisp, without being harsh, and the mids are well-presented. The bass isn't as punchy as I would like, but with how small these earbuds are that is kind of to be expected. It does provides a good level of depth without overpowering the other frequencies, but if you like a lot of bass these might not be for you. Overall, the sound quality of will please most casual listeners alike and even some music enthusiasts. These earbuds lack customizable EQ settings. This may not be a big deal to some people, but I like to adjust the bass and the highs depending on the genre of music I am listening to.Comfortable and Secure Fit:These earbuds are designed with user comfort in mind. They come with multiple ear tip sizes to ensure a secure fit for different ear shapes. The lightweight and ergonomic design make them comfortable to wear. I've worn them for about 4 hours at a time and will sometimes forget they are there. Personally the Airpods didn't fit in my ear as well and these stay in better for me.Great Noise Cancellation:I prefer active noise cancellation because the fit of passive noise cancellation is usually less comfortable. These earbuds have a solid fit and use active noise cancellation which I prefer - and is pretty impressive. Typically I like to hear my environment when walking my dogs but the noise cancellation is so good I have to turn it off. I could keep noise cancellation on with my old headphones and it really just reduced how loud the noise was. This is also really helpful when I am on a call and my dogs are in the other room. I usually have to keep muting my mic because my dogs are barking, but when testing my girlfriend couldn't hear the dogs while we were on the phone.Incredibly Stable Bluetooth Connection:The connection between these earbuds and my phone is absolutely incredible. Bluetooth connection quality can vary quite a bit but these have one of the most stable and reliable connections that I have ever seen with wireless earbuds. There is virtually no latency. I left my phone in my bedroom and walked about 100 feet and went outside into the backyard and close the door. There wasn't even a stutter with the connection. Amazing.Battery Life:There is always a claim of an impressive battery life with high end earbuds. I haven't had a chance to test yet, but I plan to drain the battery completely on the earbuds and the case and track how long it takes to charge, how long the earbud batteries last, and how long the case battery lasts. I will update this review once I have had a chance to test!Overall the Beats Studio + offer a great audio experience and sound quality, comfortable fit, and amazing wireless connection. While there are a few minor inconveniences, none of them are dealbreakers and these earbuds are a great choice for anyone seeking a good pair of wireless earbuds.","Reviewed in the United States May 19, 2023",AGYDMBJ7K2SRHYL7DHHL37MLHDUQ,1,195,Color: TransparentStyle: Studio Buds +Set: Without AppleCare+,Beats Studio Buds+,0.17694139194139194,0.4991705913134485,Neutral

They died, and I wasn’t mad because they’d lasted through sweat, rain, dust, etc. Searched and searched for a replacement, bought these as I’d had good experiences with Beats products before. Total. Letdown. The audio quality is okay, but the noise cancellation is temperamental. Battery life is good, charging is good, but that’s about it. The fit is sketchy. They actually fall out of my ears when I sweat. I expect any earbuds to loosen or slip a bit, given my large, odd ears. These, actually fall out. I cannot get the fit to stay good, no matter what size cups I use. And the connectivity is bad. They routinely stop playing sound at random, and can only be restarted from my phone (which is an iPhone) and not from the buttons on the actual earbuds. They disconnect completely sometimes, too.

R5M5AUQEOJMSM,B0BZK2Z2TC,3.0 out of 5 stars Good headphones with frustrating bug with iPhone,Laura G,3,"I like these headphones but there are some serious issues if you use these with an iPhone. Apple has owned Beats for a decade and when connected to Apple products, have a specific menu to control their functionality. I have a fully updated iPhone 11 Pro. Though it's not the newest phone, I should have to have the newest phone to use Apple-supported headphones.Pros:• I can switch between my phone, my iPad, and Macbook pretty easily. I don't have to forget my headphones on one thing in order to connect to another.• The sound quality is pretty good.• They stay in my ears well.• The physical button to pause or skip works well and has a nice feel.• Control of settings like listening mode and button function are in settings on the iOS or Mac OS without needing a third-party app or toggling manually through features on the headphones themselves.• When noise cancelling and transparent modes work, they work pretty well (see cons).Cons:• From day 1, these have had problems staying connected to my iPhone. If I pause or don't have audio playing for a short period of time (usually around 30 seconds though it's happened after about 15 seconds), the headphones disconnect. They will then attempt to reconnect but with no sound. You have to go into Bluetooth settings, disconnect the headphones, wait, and then reconnect. This is when the screen is active and being used, so it can't be blamed on the iOS going into a sleep mode or because the screen is dark. It happens on a daily basis if I pause to talk to someone or if I'm taking a moment to select my next song or YouTube video. Apple Support is no help as their solution is to forget the headphones and re-add them. This fixes the problem for less than a day. I don't have the issue if I'm connected to my laptop or iPad. Yes, my iOS is fully updated and yes, the headphones are fully charged. Again, this has been since I opened them and started using them.• After six months of use, the left earbud has an on and off thumping when I'm in noise cancelling or transparent mode. It's so bad, I've just resigned myself to not using either mode unless I have to.• No wireless charging option. This might be due to Apple proprietary tech, but it's still a con.• Approximately every two or three weeks, I can't change the noise cancelling settings because my phone thinks both headphones are out of the case (you can't use noise cancelling or transparent mode with one earbud). I would have to turn my phone off and restart it to get the modes to work again.Overall, the headache these headphones cause is not worth the convenience of their auto compatibility with Apple products or their sound quality. Apple needs to look into the bugs for iPhone and not brush them off. Won't be buying again and I'm looking for a new alternative to Apple Airpods.","Reviewed in the United States April 2, 2024",AGX7ZX53ATOLBXKS3QMWZIUUG4AQ,1,17,Color: Cosmic SilverStyle: Studio Buds +Set: Without AppleCare+,Beats Studio Buds+,0.004640151515151532,0.44919733044733046,Neutral

Recomiendo usarlos con la aplicación de Apple Music ya que la calidad de audio se aprovechará mejor en ella que en otras aplicaciones como Spotify.El emparejamiento es excelente, la cancelación de ruido no es tan buena como en los AirPod Pro de segunda generación pero si cancelan muy bien sonidos como los del viento. El modo de transparencia es regular, pero si hablas notarás que tienes un tapón puesto en los oídos.

I have tried different size cushions and it did help some but there are times when I don’t have my hands free and they start to slip out. Very frustrating. I have 1 more complaint and it may just be me but people have a hard time hearing me when I take a call with them on. 90% of the time I have to take them out to finish my conversation.LoveOn a positive note the battery life is really good. They send out 2-3 warning alerts to let you know the batteries are nearing the end of their life. it’s great because it gives you plenty of time before your cut off. If your like me and only wear 1 at a time, the alerts gives you lots of time to switch out to the other bud before your cut off.I also love the noise canceling feature but if you don’t love it there is actually a setting that lets you turn it off.

RR59V1YTAKMN3,B0BZK2Z2TC,3.0 out of 5 stars Be aware if you are an AirPods user...,P. Liu,3,"For me, the battery life at around 75% volume is around 7h50m with ANC and Transparency set to Off. The sound quality, and I've owned several HiFi headsets including HiFiMan and Sennheiser's, is nothing ground breaking or it's just typical Beats. So it's okay if you know the Beats sound. For my ears, the default plugs works fine and doesn't appear to fall out.So, several things to note:1) it Does Not automatically switch sources on Apple platforms like AirPods does(you have to manually switch)! It does, however, pair once and connects to all of your devices under the same Apple ID. So it sits somewhere in between the traditional BT headset and an AirPods.2) The case is wider than AirPods Pro case by more than ~1/2"" and taller by ~1/4""... So, kinda big but pocketable.3) For reasons unclear to me, mine unit charges to 98-99%... Not sure what's causing that4) No iOS 'Fit Test' for these buds... So choosing the right plug is your call!5) One reason I'm debugging and still might return the item: On a phone call or FaceTime call, at some point in the call, the other person can not hear my voice until I switch back to either Speaker or iPhone. The little Googling I did suggest that I'm not alone in this, and switching to Speaker then Back to the Buds might recover the microphone. But it's unacceptable for my sound to drop out on a call and not knowing it's happening until the other parties mentioned it. Until I can resolve this, I won't be doing any phone calls or using the microphones on this thing... Unresolved, I will return it!","Reviewed in the United States June 30, 2024",AF5USDTPPMDQCVOELHMZTQMMA42Q,1,1,Color: Cosmic SilverStyle: Studio Buds +Set: Without AppleCare+,Beats Studio Buds+,0.12084821428571427,0.36248015873015876,Neutral

I appreciate the attempt to make a product more buyer accessible than their powerbeats pro/fit (which at this point are simply overpriced). That said, these buds+ are lackluster at just about everything except listening to audio in quiet-moderately loud environments.Pros: They fit well enough, stay in ear, and are comfortable enough that i often walk into meetings forgetting that I have them in (and then end up yelling a bit do to the anc dulling).Cons: These are absolutely terrible for phone and video calls (facetime, whatsapp, Teams, Zoom, etc). Multiple chats have resulted in me giving up and using my gym headphones or the built in speaker. If these weren't a gift, i'd be upset as travel/in office is my main use case. IYou're better off buying airpods if you want something all around. OR pay more for the powerbeats or Sony buds (could be others that are solid but those are the two i can directly speak to).

The sound quality is good for the price. Scale of 1 to 10. Bass is 7 and Treble is 8. Sound is crisp with no interference or background hiss. Bluetooth is strong, comparable to AirPods if not slightly better. Only drawback is the earbud housing material is slick plastic making it an effort to remove from the case especially in cold weather when the fingers are dry. A grippier material would work better to remove them from the case. I recommend these earbuds if you want to step up prior to investing AirPods.

I asked around at work and it was a tie between these and the second gen airpods pro for popularity. Having an android phone, I knew that if I went with the airpods again, all the headache that would come with using them with an android phone, so I bought the beats studio buds +. Despite having one of the longest names in beats history, these buds have just as long of a battery, claiming nine hours on a charge, which when using them during 12 hour work shifts, I can attest to being true and then some. As someone who has never liked noise cancelling headphones, I actually really enjoy these, especially when on a bus or a plane, they make a huge difference. The sound quality is sharp and clean, and the bass is not overpowering, but still quite noticeable, using the same tricks as the airpods pro. This shouldn't be a surprise because these use the same chip as the airpods family of headphones, so they work great on iPhone, but just as well on android.Pairing is simple and controlled using an app (on Android), which allows all control that would normally be found in iPhone settings","Reviewed in the United States April 22, 2024",AHQOAZEU53L72SUQOALTM7EC3YKQ,1,2,Color: TransparentStyle: Studio Buds +Set: Without AppleCare+,Beats Studio Buds+,0.12009803921568629,0.5357142857142858,Neutral

It usually works, but sometimes something strange happens and the people I am talking to complain about the voice quality. This has nothing to do with the noise level because it happens in pretty quiet places as well.For listening to music and audio books it is excellent. My favorite thing is that each earbud can be used independently while the other one is charging. This means that I can listen to podcasts and audio books non-stop. Battery life is very good as well. ANC is excellent as well.The only complaint I have is with the microphone being flaky. Everything else is amazing. Unfortunately I bought it specifically for the microphone.","Reviewed in the United States May 13, 2024",AGCUQGEY2AZ5NQM5WYWW5RSVHRFQ,1,0,Color: TransparentStyle: Studio Buds +Set: Without AppleCare+,Beats Studio Buds+,0.20055555555555551,0.6275925925925926,Positive

RWUFM677B047O,B0BZK2Z2TC,5.0 out of 5 stars One of the best out there but...,Honest Reviewer Zach,5,"This is hands down one of the best earbuds in the world period. Some cons that I've noticed after using them are.Cons:-The left earbud has low static sound when nothing is playing.-The earbuds pick up a ton of background noise with their microphones. But it's normal.-Note that it's impossible to speak to someone on the phone while, for example you're at a pretty loud gym.-Putting one earbud into the case, pauses whatever you're playing from your phone.-I personally never use transparency mode. However, when putting one earbud into the case, it always switches to transparency mode, and you have to manually change it on the app. The app doesn't allow to set default modes.Pros:-They are build very strong, and earbuds wouldn't come apart and break even if you step on them.-Earbuds are able to connect/link to two devices at the same time and switch between them seamlessly. Few earbuds have this capability if any.-Additionally, earbuds are able to link to your Google account and connect to devices much easier.Overall, very good noise cancellation, sound quality, decent bass, battery life, charging speed, design, feel, and look.Two month update: Sometimes the system notifications get messed up - it notifies you about the percentage of the case and both earbuds every 5 seconds. Sometimes one of the earbuds goes out, without a low battery warning. Putting them into a case for a few seconds fixes this. Also sometimes the noise cancelling gets messed up - it does the exact opposite - adds noise. Again putting both of the earbuds for a couple of seconds into the case fixes this.Six month update:I had to send this product for repair (directly to apple) tree times before all issues were fixed. The first two times, it was free, but the third time I had to pay $84 for them to get fixed.","Reviewed in the United States November 29, 2023",AELKL63BZ7XFD27KO3R6BEVSDWRA,1,68,Color: TransparentStyle: Studio Buds +Set: Without AppleCare+,Beats Studio Buds+,0.17725925925925926,0.4282407407407407,Neutral

You open the top of the charging base, they auto connect. I’ve never used this function before and I’m very happy it’s there. Now for the sound. Everything is equal. So not much xtra on the base. These are immersive buds. I could hear every individual instrument, clearly. I’m kind of amazed there is no eq function or an app of any sort. Not really needed or a deal breaker but I like to tinker.are they worth $170? Hell no and I’d expect to see a drop in price m, very soon. But for the price I got them at, a little over a hundred in good, used condition, these are the best in that class. If you can find these for $130 and under, do it. Otherwise there are better premium options out there. Good but not great battery. If you’re planning on using them for more than four hours, you might have an issue.

RMPLDDXZA8MAF,B0BZK2Z2TC,4.0 out of 5 stars Solid earphones for a casual listener || 4.5 stars,Rayshau T.,4,"I have had these earphones for about a day now. This is my first Beats product. I bought these as a much needed replacement for my first gen AirPods that I purchased at launch. Thus far, I have used the earphones around the house while doing chores, relaxing on the couch, and at work. The sound quality is pretty good. While the earphones themselves have no equalizer settings, I mostly use Spotify and have been able to tune the buds to my desired taste through Spotify.The active noise canceling is easy to turn on/off and I was really surprised how well they work. My washing/dryer unit can be fairly noisy in my open floor plan apartment. I could not hear it running at all when I put the noise canceling on.I love the aesthetic of the buds and they fit perfectly in my ears out of the box. I do miss the feature of my AirPods where the buds would start/stop playing if it was inserted/removed from my ears. I can see myself accidentally putting the buds down and forgetting they are still going. I deducted a star because while the case and buds are stylish and sleek, I find they are a bit too smooth. the buds are a little difficult to firmly grasp and I’m afraid they’ll slip out of my fingers while handling them. Fingers crossed I don’t lose them.Overall though.

In my uploaded picture, you'll see a little black ""mustache"" / lip protrusion that I added using electrical tape because I found myself always hunting to find the lid's edge when I went to open the case. (Like the way you ""hunt"" for the right way to insert a USB cable. 🙂) This feature improved usability for me and I'm mentioning here in case the manufacturer has anyone reading these reviews for future improvements.I like how you can use the app to customize behavior /settings of the earbuds, and really like how if you leave one inserted, it can (with the right settings) use amplification to make it so you're hearing normally, as though nothing is blocking your ear canal.I was used to other earbuds that were capacitive touch and wanted to point out that these are tactile touch, meaning you need to push the surface of the earbud to click the button. You'll feel a little click when it works each time but it's barely perceptible and not annoying.The only problem I had and ultimately had to return them is that I routinely had feedback on calls that the mics were inconsistently picking up my voice.","Reviewed in the United States January 14, 2024",AFEHMC3NEQ5CJN4XTMXZZBK7NPCQ,1,5,Color: Cosmic SilverStyle: Studio Buds +Set: Without AppleCare+,Beats Studio Buds+,0.09319727891156462,0.5324829931972789,Neutral

AirPod pros don’t fit in my ears well and I ended up choosing the fit pros over these. These ones looked ridiculous in my ear, like two rectangles or a ruler sticking so far out of my ears when looking at me from the front. I also thought the sound was a lot more sharp, like s, sh, and f sounds were super highlighted and tinny for my liking. That, along with the stupid way they looked in my small ears made me choose the fit pros. Which are still big but for some reason they don’t stick out as obviously as the studio buds+.

The noise canceling on these earbuds are okay but by no means great. Were these really shine is the call quality. The voice clarity on both ends of a call was fantastic. The easy pair for IOS was very helpful and simple but I wish there was a EQ added. The comfort for me was great for the first hour but after that it really started to hurt my ears even after swapping ear tips. I would say these are great for everyday use and most people would really enjoy them but for me that really didn’t work out.

If u ever have issue you will need.3rd & final what you read for---➡️❤️ My original review is below and still valid but after cleaning and adjusting tips, I'm happy to report I haven't had the 'connect from pocket problem'. Changing the tips made a big diff, but they're not near as secure and comfortable as pixel buds pro for my everyday use. That bring said, the pass through, pass thru blend, etc are the best hands down. Their competition isn't even close for this category(IMO_of_course).The only thing I find myself having to adjust often. They want to sit halfway in my ear, instead of locked into place. Many times when I go to adjust, I hit pause, which could be disabled in all fairness. I still use these as my everyday buds though, and are about to try more tips when I can find the time. They are superior in sound and especially the noise cancellation/passthrough/blend feature. It's actually amazing how good they are in all honesty. (If you don't like foam tips, get some silicone because these only come with the foam style.) (The tips are the same though as any other set.)I just wanted to come back and follow up.They deserve five stars.⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐. I have to leave the one star off but if I could I'd rate them 4.7-4.8, so sorry it's not five stars for a pretty solid product.I hope this can help someone, and give yourself a day or two once getting to be able to see the difference, since they have some pretty solid picks out there. Thanks, & may the good Lord bless.❤️I had the 3rd & 4th Gen earbuds, so upon getting these, I was wondering did I make the right choice, coming from pixel buds pro? I'm happy to report, that after changing the tips to some older silicone traditional Sony tips, they surprised me how nice they were to use. I also was happy about the longer lasting battery, and quality passthrough experience then what I had gotten used to. All in all, these are pleasantly nice once I put the silicone ear tips on. They fit perfect now and have my recommendation. Edit- I've had a little time with them, and the couple things I don't care for so far, is Amazon music service; I disabled nearby devices, because every time I connect buds after accepting update, they offer a service to be ready to play music with a tap. It's good if that's what you want, but not for me at the time. Now the other issue is actually an issue that has me really concerned whether I want to use them long-term. The right ear bud every time I look is connected in the case/paired to my phone which is a dealbreaker if I can't seem to correct. I'm sorry to report this because it's something that matters a lot to me and a reason I would return to the pixel buds pro. Anyway the sound and noise cancellation is second to none , and I can honestly say, they close the pixel buds pro out of the water. This is the reason I still only subtracted one star for a five star product.

R39IFB4SI371KS,B0C345M3T7,3.0 out of 5 stars I really wanted to like them,Jonathan M. Silveira,3,"PROS- Very tiny and pocketable case with a flat bottom (stands up on its own)- Lightweight and small earbuds- ""Bragging rights""CONS- Very slippery/glossy earbud sides- ANC on and off sounded 100% the same to me- Case felt cheap/fragile- Sony app is a disaster/often did not recognize earbuds even after connecting to Bluetooth- Battery life wasn't all thatI bought these buds to replace my aging Jabra 75t Active. They supposedly sounded amazing and had top tier ANC. They do sound slightly better, but ANC didn't work for me at all. I tried all ear tip sizes multiple times, tried jamming them into my ears to the point of hurting myself, and ANC did not work at all. I'd turn it on and off a bunch of times in a row and heard absolutely no difference whatsoever. I knew the right fit was very important for ANC to work and tried everything I could. So either I have alien ears or my earbuds were defective.The sides of the earbuds are glossy and very slippery. It's difficult getting them out of the case. I felt like I never really had a good grip on them and was deathly afraid of dropping my very expensive earbuds. The feeling is the same taking them out of my ears to put them in the case. Being constantly afraid of dropping them didn't work for me.The hinge and the top half of the case felt really thin and cheap. It felt like it could snap in half with just a little bit of force. Not a huge issue, though.The Sony app is a clusterduck of epic proportions. It's like they put the sales committee in charge of designing it. It's just awful in every way. Everything is hidden in an unnecessary menu and has a weird name/description. And having to create a Sony account to use certain features was the last straw.I expected much better battery life according to their specs. It'll probably last the full 8 hours, but don't count on it if you need them for something important towards the second half of your day. They did last longer than my aging 75t Active, but not by a substantial amount. I had ANC on at all times, trying to notice any difference between having it on of off. I never tested the battery life on these with ANC off.Other than Sony's app not recognizing the earbuds after connecting them to Bluetooth, I had zero issues with connectivity. They connected every time and I never experienced drops.I just didn't get enough benefits to justify the price of these earbuds. I then bought the Jabra Elite 8 Active and, although they're not ""high-end"" (no bragging rights), they're a huge upgrade to everything I care about. The ANC works very well and I barely have to place the earbuds in my ears. They're a lot easier to grip and feel secure in my hands and ears. The battery life is absurd. I charge my case once every 5 or 6 days (with ANC on 24/7). If I turned it off, I might not have to recharge them until next year.I've been eyeing Sony's earbuds since the XM3, but never felt they were worth the price vs. features. After the XM5 came out, I finally thought there was a chance they were good enough. Unfortunately, that didn't happen to me.","Reviewed in the United States April 30, 2024",AFNCA6NW243WSGZNHIWBJ4RGFVXA,1,4,Color: Black,Sony WF-1000XM5,0.017594086021505383,0.5407334869431644,Neutral
RAGFSOGI67D6,B0C345M3T7,"4.0 out of 5 stars Clear, quiet, smaller and lighter than the XM4",Someone,4,"I use a range of Sony headphones and earbuds, from the MDR-Z1R to the IER-M9 to consumer models like the WH-1000XM and WF-1000XM series. It all depends on where I am (at home, on the go locally, or traveling) and what equipment I'm using (a Sony digital music player with a balanced headphone output jack or Bluetooth LDAC support, or a simple iPhone that only supports the Bluetooth AAC codec).My WF-1000XM5 pair arrived July 28, 2023 (the day before I wrote this review). After testing them and completing the initial update to the 2.0.1 firmware (by the time you read this, there may be a newer version), I found that I just left the earbuds in for the rest of the day, whether I was listening to music, making calls, or enjoying some quiet time. They're smaller, lighter, and more comfortable than my WF-1000XM4 pair, to the point that I don't really notice I'm wearing them.Sound-wise, there is a noticeable improvement in bass and in the midrange. I didn't notice much of a difference in treble, although I like less bass and more treble than the average person (hence my choice of the IER-M9 over the two alternatives in that product line).The noise-canceling has improved across the board. As always, it's important to try the different tips, including the possibility that you will need a different size in each ear. I was surprised to see that mentioned in the in-app tutorial!I am used to third-party expanding foam tips for my WF-1000XM4 pair, so we'll see whether third-party vendors offer something similar for the new model. For now, the stock tips work fine. They remind me of the alternate-texture tips that come with the IER-M9.Now, a few flaws, worth mentioning given the price of this product...First, Sony's model numbering is stupid and not consumer-friendly. Normal people can get excited about ""AirPods"" but not about ""WF-1000XM5s"".Second, the charging case, though now significantly smaller, still lacks any sort of finding feature. It would have been a simple matter for Sony to add the ability, through the clunky Headphones Connect app, to make a pair of earbuds in the case play a loud sound so you could find the case if you'd misplaced it. Apple of course makes precisely locating its products very easy.Third, in their hubris, product designers at Sony have made something small and lovely but forgotten about the environments in which it will be used. There is NO tactile feedback to let us distinguish the left earbud from the right. The L and R marks are tiny (just millimeters tall) and the use of dull grey for L and red for R makes them invisible in the dark. If I'm out walking in the evening without the case, have taken off the earbuds for a moment, and am putting them back on, I should not have to use my iPhone's flash to tell left from right.Last but not least, the Headphones Connect app is becoming an ever more elaborate trainwreck. There are just too many options and features. With no distinction between what's essential and what's not, you have to open three tabs in succession, scroll down, and open endless settings panels (each accessed by a gear icon) to cover everything. Pesty notifications come back every time you start the app, even if you deleted them the last time. Sony tries again and again to make you sign up for various accounts, and is of course gathering information about you, your cell phone, and your listening activity every time you use their app. Since Sony's 360 spatial audio only works with a handful of paid, proprietary music apps (a big gap, compared to the more-or-less universal, iOS-level support for this feature with Apple wireless headphones and earbuds), I don't even bother setting it up.Overall, the WF-1000XM5 is an excellent pair of wireless earbuds in terms of sound, noise canceling, and comfort, and Sony could make improvements by renaming them, adding a raised plastic dot to make the right earbud distinguishable by touch, and ditching the Headphones Connect app in favor a lightweight (and ideally, data-privacy-conscious) control panel.","Reviewed in the United States July 29, 2023",AGVLBVPSFJOBQEMVAK5P6VZFA22Q,1,184,Color: Black,Sony WF-1000XM5,0.11319666645753602,0.44414225066398977,Neutral

They fit well (which took a bit of user-error to get right), but because they offer so many options for use it's taking me a bit to learn which taps where produce the desired effect of controlling volume rather than calling someone. I much prefer these to Shokz Openrun bone cancelling headphones in the gym, which I used to use, because I can exclude grunting and yelling emanating from some of my weight-lifting comrades. And they aren't affected by sweat like over-ear noise-cancelling headphones, which I also tried. Why, you might ask, not immerse myself in the sounds of the gym? Because.","Reviewed in the United States June 24, 2024",AFTMAKG6KSLVFYMFREKXN3LDHO4A,1,0,Color: Black,Sony WF-1000XM5,0.3142857142857143,0.405952380952381,Positive
R1MUT5VCSYZXP9,B0C345M3T7,5.0 out of 5 stars From XM4 to WF-1000XM5,Cameron D.,5,"The reviews are fairly unclear on these earbuds, and I wonder how much of it is due to their other hardware, or technical literacy.I'm running the WF-1000XM5 on android along with Wavelet, and upgraded hybrid tips, and I'm completely satisfied. The sound profile is different than the XM4s, but I hear more detail than before. I also agree the ANC relies more on passive than active cancelation, so a correct seal is crucial whereas it was less crucial on the XM4s.Once I used the autoeq, and fully setup Wavelet, the XM5s are clearly an upgrade in sound quality.I have yet to fly with them, but next time I do I'll update that part. So far no hissing, pressure, or oddness though, so I'm not sure why there are so many bad reviews.

The fact of the matter was the xm4 left was only charging 40per and the R wasnt much better. After only 4 months of a refurb purchase on AMZ. However, the sound and noise cancelling was outstanding, so I bought a set of XM5s here on AMZ.Bottom line- much better overall. An issue I had on Android was FLAC and wav files skipping. Its always been the case. Seems like this has been fixed- finally! as the XM5s havent skipped once, during hours and hours of play so far. The audio is improved- it sounds really quite excellent. The noise cancelling has taken a notch down. Not sure why- but it is not very good now. Ive read many comments from other complaining the same. Its all a tradeoff, no doubt Sony engineers put more emphasis on sound quality and no skipping. All in all, they are still my go-to choice for earbuds. I hope the battery holds up longer than the xm4. When you have something so good- the biggest fear is losing it... I just hope they keep working/stick around!

R357ZLBP3YRC07,B0C345M3T7,4.0 out of 5 stars Comparison to XM4 and Bose QC2,Janine,4,"I'll keep it brief since others have reviewed more thoroughly.First thing, and I'm shocked to say this-- they actually are tricky to pull out of the case because of the shape and smoothness. It's unbelievable that a huge company can make a product so good in some ways and then just like, what, not actually try to use it before mass-production? It's genuinely worth removing a star for. They could have put just a ring of textured area or a silicone band embedded; or just a little ribbing. It would have been trivial, and should have been obvious from the first test.I think I read someone say they wanted a way to distinguish between left and right. There is a small but obvious bump on the left bud, for this purpose.Bose are more comfortable-- there just is no comparison. If you get a combination of tips and wings that fit your ear, it's like you've got nothing at all in your ear. It is THAT good. The Sony XM4 was irritating by kind-of rubbing against the inner ear when fully inserted. The XM5 have resolved that by being very slightly shorter. They are comfortable if you are used to in-ear buds, especially well-sealing ones. They will never be as comfortable as the Bose.XM5 sound quality is very similar to XM4. I prefer the sound of the XM5 to Bose for almost anything. The Quietcomfort 2 really emphasizes a kickdrum and then bass is muted. It's probably somewhat adjustable in the app EQ, but I didn't try. Percussion like shakers, cymbals, hats, etc all sound more realistic on the XM5 than the Bose-- the Bose makes them sound both synthesized/""fake"" and undefined at the same time. Mind you, the Sony is not audiophile grade-- if you have nice cans then you will definitely find the Sonys lacking. But they're great for what they are, and better than the Bose.Bose takes longer to turn on and connect (several seconds), but they take less time to get comfortably situated in the ear.Noise cancellation-- Bose are noticeably (10-15%) better at cancelling white noises (fans, air purifier, airplane). So for a long-haul flight where that and comfort are most important, the Bose win. Sony, however, did better at cancelling out sudden noises and voices, as well as background music. So for the gym, Sony's win.But really, for most people, it's a toss-up. I wouldn't recommend upgrading from the XM4, and the difference between the Sony and Bose will mostly come down to preference for comfort. If you never find earbuds comfortable, get the Bose, be happy, and don't look back. If you like the Sony sound signature and fit, and are due for a new pair, I do recommend the Sony WF-1000XM5.I'll update this when I figure out a way to mod the buds to be easier to remove from the case. Probably a little light sanding to the shell, or a few tiny dots of epoxy","Reviewed in the United States November 23, 2023",AE6ACY5ETVCP4TYOU6DXABPL53IQ,1,10,Color: Silver,Sony WF-1000XM5,0.19338023088023096,0.47351689160512683,Neutral
R274ZGSZLMKFAL,B0C345M3T7,"3.0 out of 5 stars Not as good as I hoped, I am returning them.",Paul M.,3,"I am a big Sony fan with 6 of their top TV models, 4 cameras, and 5 pairs of head and ear phones in our family. Unfortunately, I have watched their top of the line designs (TV's and headphones in particular) change from 'cost no object quality products' to designs that are purposely simplified and cheapened to save in manufacturing costs. A good example is the change from the XM4 headphones to XM5 models with the later looking like a sub $100 pair of headphones with weak pivot points, poor folding size, large case, cheap plastic, and thin bass sound. Those headphones at least improved the mids and highs...which I cannot say for these WF-1000XM5 earbuds. It seems Sony finds some great wins, then removes those that work in the next revisions to be different and does not listen to their customers. An example is the effective voice confirmations in mode changes that now are replaced with beeps and some modes being removed. This is very helpful in flights, when there is a lot of ambient noise.These WF-1000XM5 earbuds epitomize this cheap concept in being too slippery (what happened to the nice matt finish in XM4's), awkward to handle and insert, weird fitting in the case as they rock around not making contact, and exuding a boomy cheap sound. The case seems like it was designed for a different product. To be clear, I gave them plenty of time to break in and though they improved...they plateaued way too soon. I understand cost savings are important, but these earphones are $300 and marketed as their best and these do not exude quality like their previous models and this is immediately obvious. The gloss finish is very slippery, not ideal for handling and looks cheap. The attractive bronze (rose gold?) accents from the past are all but gone. They are moderately comfortable but leak sound making you constantly guess whether or not ambient sound is on or off. Touch control seems more irregular and modes are removed. Conversely, I have found my XM4's (I have 2 pairs) to sometimes cause mild pain in my ears over long use which I did not experience with these XM5's though the XM5 for me feel like they are falling out with their more rounded shape.The soundstage is muddy and closed in and does not outperform the XM4 earphones, in my opinion. Some music with perfect recordings sounds OK, but across the board they fall short in getting the best out of the music and I listen to many types of music. Just like the WH-1000XM5 headphones (which I returned to keep XM4's), these are no better sounding than their predecessors and for me the sound quality is first and foremost. Accuracy has always been Sony's forte but I have found that has changed. I have high end audio equipment including tube amps, and a full home theater so admittingly I might be a little picky; however previous models from Sony have kept me content and not a single flight I take is without their headphones or earphones.The ANC and phone call quality are very good but as the foam does not seal well there is that sound leakage in my ears no matter which tips I tried or how I turned them...meaning many will have to buy aftermarkets right away to get that softer better conforming ear pad...which is not a requirement with many of their competitors. I truly feel like Sony's design team did not spend enough time to cross the t's and dot the i's for these headphones and the budget was too low for a high quality design. The battery life is worse than previous models and I tested them side by side with XM4 using the same settings and same volume. They are smaller...for those who need to save space but I would prefer sound quality improvements over reduction in size. They are also more efficient with less more volume from a lower setting on my S23 Ultra.I did the prepurchase for these earphones and use my others daily but unfortunately I returned them and will stick with the previous models as I try others...which is disappointing. I was surprised about the many positive professional reviews and it does make me feel like they could be a little biased.","Reviewed in the United States August 24, 2023",AFKFGM46ICLUVJTWLHT4IJ2F62EQ,1,61,Color: Black,Sony WF-1000XM5,0.178198355951165,0.4924235128167712,Neutral

Purely subjective audio comparisons between my favorite over ear headphones were amazing, however the tips (the swappable part which actually fits in your ear) degraded and the coating stripped away within 2 months of use. Sony provides different sizes to fit different ears, HOWEVER, you can not buy additional tips on their own. So if you lose it or it degrades as mine did, you're screwed. I'm currently awaiting delivery of a pair of third party XM5 eartips, hopefully they save the day. 10/10 audio quality and comfort, 10/10 battery life and charging speed, 0/10 on the longevity of the eartips.

R2WKBVSP2REH6C,B0C345M3T7,"3.0 out of 5 stars Good size, doesn't block noise with stock tips",Frisco,3,"My favorite ear buds were the Jabra Elite 75t, but unfortunately the volume in the right bud got too soft and they stopped making them, so I replaced them with the Jabra 7 pros. The Jabra 7 pros sounded better, but the case was too bulky, the microphones were useless (no one could understand me on phone calls), and they were super glitchy. Several times it became impossible to use both earbuds at once and I had to reset them, or one of the buds just didn't charge in the case. I got Elevoc Clear buds just so I could make phone calls, but having two pairs of earbuds was not practical. I thought of getting the Bose QC 2, but the battery life of 6 hours was just not enough for me. So when these Sony WF1000xm5 came out with an 8 hour ANC battery life, I thought they might be right for me...The good: The charging case is tiny, reminiscent of the Jabra 75ts--maybe even smaller. There's multipoint and all the features you could want. I had no trouble pairing them with my Pixel 7 pro and my linux laptop. I've tested on phone calls and people have no problem understanding me. So I don't know know if the mics are as good as the Elevoc clear, but at least these are good enough for phone calls (unlike the Jabra 7 pros). Unlike what is claimed in other reviews, there is a small little spike on top of the left earbud, so you can easily tell the left and right apart even in the dark.The bad: The noise cancellation did not work at all, because the ear tips don't seal in my ears. Fortunately, the Sony android app will let you test for this, but I tested all four tip sizes and couldn't get any of them to seal. Eventually what I did was take the tips off my Jabra 7 pros and put them on the Sony WF1000XM5s, and that got a seal. That's not a great solution because I still might want to use my Jabras as backup. (Moreover, the Sony ear tips have an ear wax filter, whereas the Jabras don't, so I'm worried this could be a long-term problem.) I ordered the both the AZLA Crystal and the AZLA XELASTIC tips, and found that the large XELASTIC tips worked well for me, but not the Crystal (even though Crystal is a newer supposedly better product). So now I have good headphones, but incurred an additional expense and shipping delay for tips on top of already expensive ear buds.Some more minor criticisms: The buds are a little hard to get out of the case because they are so smooth. The controls aren't quite as flexible as on the Jabra--there are just two configurations possible for each ear bud, as opposed to being able to attach any function you want to any action (single, double, triple press, etc.). I experienced one minor glitch, where the passthrough did not work on the left ear bud, even though I could switch between ANC and passthrough by tapping that ear bud; the problem was fixed when I put the ear buds in the case and removed them again.Overall, despite the issues, I'm excited to have a tiny pair of ear buds again that are good for both listening to media and making phone calls. I just think that for the price, this should be a product that just works out of the box and doesn't require after-market tips. Maybe my ears are weird, but I've never had a fit problem with either of the Jabra buds I owned, or the two pairs of wired Shure ear buds I had before that. (I did find etymotic ear buds uncomfortable until I got custom molded tips.)","Reviewed in the United States July 31, 2023",AGVPGI4XUHSOHCDCTPYECMPS5YZA,1,38,Color: Black,Sony WF-1000XM5,0.10402298850574712,0.5030172413793103,Neutral

The sound quality was as expected from Bose. The set up was easy and quick. However, at the end of the week I was ready to trash them (I sent them back) - they would not stay connected to either my iPhone 12 Pro Max or my MSI WS-75 Workstation. They were good for about 10 minutes, and then would have to reconnect.I then decided to try something different - Beyer Dynamics is a big name in studio monitor quality speakers, headphones and mics. They have a solution - the ""FreeByrds""."" Three drivers in each ear - unsurpassed sound and clarity..."" They did have good sound, they stayed connected, but the noise cancelation was non-existant (The reason that I wanted new NOIsE CANCELING earbuds for). I have a pair of 12 yr old Bose wired earbuds that block more sound than those were, and they aren't (weren't) catigorized as being noise blocking or canceling. The set up was long and complicated. Those should be back at the music store today.So I sprung for about $100 more and ordered a pair of Sony WF-1000XM5's. They stay connected. They sound really good (as good as the Bose? It's been a few weeks, too long to honestly compair...but these sound really good), they stay connected (actually you can connect to 2 sources at the same time if you want), and the noise cancellation is amazing, but I think not quite as good as the Bose (why I gave them 4 starts instead of 5). The set up was a bit more compilicated than the Bose were, and these fit inside your ear canal, where the Bose where more of an external fit. I wish I would have gotten these first...oh, and battery life is great. With the Auto Abmient setting off, I am easily going to get 10 hours out of a single charge today - and that is sitting at my desk enjoying great music all day with no other sound to degrade what I am hearing...and the case is good for two full charges.Based on what I know after 4 or 5 days - I would buy these again.","Reviewed in the United States December 4, 2023",AFB72QDWJBFQ5FVTUN7DDSZ3QDPA,1,39,Color: Black,Sony WF-1000XM5,0.30698953823953834,0.45960798460798463,Positive
R10MW8VJCMCP3H,B0C345M3T7,4.0 out of 5 stars You need aftermarket tips,Jim W.,4,"I have had Bowers & Wilkens corded earbuds for years and the sound on those is superior to anything I have tried, including these earbuds. But the B&W buds died three times in five years with the same problem so I decided to move on, though I still believe B&W sound, be it speakers or earphones is superior to anything out there. But reliability is an issue. So after reading many reviews I decided to try these earbuds. I was really disappointed in the sound quality but the issue was I could not get an airtight fit with the tips provided. The test in the app repeatedly said that I did not have an airtight fit no matter how hard I tried to jam them in my ears or which tips I used. I noted that this was a highly returned item for Amazon and was about to join the crowd and return them. But before I did that I did some research on aftermarket tips and saw that many people who had problems with the fit of their Sony earbuds were able to fix the problem by using Complyfoam tips. So I gave them a shot, and they worked. I got an airtight fit confirmed by the app right away and they stay put and are comfortable for long periods. So with that fixed, my opinion is that these earbuds are not as good sounding as B&W but are better sounding than Bose. Noise cancellation is just okay with the tips provided but is excellent with the Complyfoam tips. Bose level noise cancellation with Complyfoam tips. But Sony really needs to provide much better tips to avoid all the returns. Given the cost of these earbuds, not everyone will be willing to fork out more money for aftermarket tips.","Reviewed in the United States February 21, 2024",AF5O74ALZJFF6CCGAXGQ52IARIHA,1,4,Color: Black,Sony WF-1000XM5,0.34841543513957307,0.5402545155993432,Positive

After the case broke i decided to upgrade. Overall they work and sound great but there are some things I have issue with.-the shape is slightly odd. The previous version would fit in snug and not move much and had a flat profile/sat flush in your ear. This version is smaller/thinner in the body so it can jostle and shift in your ear if pressed slightly on any side.-this version doesn’t audibly tell you how charged they are when you first put them in. Not major but I found useful-my biggest gripe is the prongs(maybe nodes? Idk) on the earbuds themselves aren’t flush or recessed so they stick out ever so slightly.

It might seem inconsequentially small but It can def hurt depending on where it pokes your earOverall not bad.

RTCP1TRJO3KJ6,B0C345M3T7,3.0 out of 5 stars XM5 vs XM4 vs AIRPODS PRO 2 -- WHY THE XM5s ARE GOING BACK,Charles Nordlander,3,"Ever since they were released, and until recently, the Sony XM4 earbuds have been my favorite, ahead of my AirPods Pro 2 and Sennheiser Momentum True Wireless 2. I say ""until recently,"" because the most recent firmware updates to the AirPods Pro 2 dethroned the XM4 at the top. In fact, if you haven't heard the Pro 2 running the latest firmware, you haven't really heard them at all. I've had the Pro 2 since release date, too, and while I felt they were an excellent update to the first gen Pro, the XM4s still bettered them in ANC and sound quality. Not any longer. The degree to which Apple improved both ANC and sound quality through firmware updates is not something I would have believed was possible. In fact, for a recent trip that involved a 9 hour nonstop flight each way, I left my Airpods Max headphones at home, only took my Pro 2 earbuds and didn't miss the Max one bit.SO... I was very anxious to hear what Sony accomplished with the XM5s, 2 years after the superb XM4s. And after spending the past week listening to them, I'll be sending them back. My issues:Fit: The only way I could get a ""good seal"" per the Sony app was by using the largest ear tips, which I found grew quickly uncomfortable in my ear. Even then, I had to twist the earbuds in deeply ""just so"" or the app would tell me to adjust them again. WAY too finicky to achieve what was ultimately an uncomfortable fit anyway. I don't have this issue with the XM4s or my Pro 2s. Plus, the Sony XM5 tips include an ear wax filter which I'm assuming is there for a reason, so I'd be hesitant to replace them with more comfortable tips that lack a filter.The Thud: As others have noted, the XM5s very audibly ""thud"" each time your foot hits the ground when jogging, running or even briskly walking.ANC & Sound Quality: Sony has definitely bettered the XM4 somewhat in both areas. Not dramatically, but still there. Measured testing I've seen shows that the XM5 better the Pro 2 a bit in cancelling lower frequency noise while the Pro 2 does better in the mid and upper frequency sound. I'd call it a draw. Similarly, while I prefer the sound signature of the Pro 2 running the latest firmware--it's a more open, natural and less processed sounding to my ear--others might prefer Sony's bassier sound. Since neither is objectively ""better"" than the other, I'd call this a draw, too. BUT... you've got the fit and thud issues with the Sony. If you can't get the fit of the XM5s to ""seal,"" and stay that way, both sound quality and ANC take a big hit. Plus the thuds are a constant annoyance that can overwhelm the sound quality.Bottom line: the AirPods Pro 2 remain at the top of the pack for me. And while the XM5s definitely improve on the ANC and sound quality of the XM4s, they introduce new issues which, for me, negate these improvements and leave the XM4s my preference in actual day-to-day use. For these reasons the XM5s are going back. BUT... if you like the XM5 sound signature, can live with the thudding and can manage to get a sealed fit easily whenever you put them in, you'll be happy with the XM5s.","Reviewed in the United States August 6, 2023",AGR2RTJI3ED3RVJ34KVRK7OO2BSQ,1,9,Color: Black,Sony WF-1000XM5,0.23291375291375302,0.48455710955710923,Positive

R8G2XNS5K9IWO,B0C345M3T7,3.0 out of 5 stars Sony has us fooled,Scott C,3,"TL/DR: Sony makes sleek looking, clean sounding headphones with all the bells and whistles, and they've parlayed that into an image of ""the best"". They're not... Not by a long shot.I bought the XM4s because they had every feature you could imagine and all the reviews said they were the best, and I enjoyed them, despite the fact that they became extremely painful to wear after an hour or so. Bought the XM5s because they were supposed to be the same but lighter and smaller, but the pain still came, just after two hours instead of one.Sennheiser was my favorite brand before Sony and the Momentum 3 buds have 90% feature parity, so I ordered a pair to see if they were any more comfortable, and whether I'd even miss LDAC.My first impression was that the Senns felt more premium and the touch controls were easier to use. I loaded up the app and found that to be a much better experience, with far deeper customization options. I set the touch controls exactly how I wanted them - something I could never do with Sony's app - and sat playing with the sound personalization widget for the better part of an hour, marveling at how it was able to highlight the specific tone and details I enjoy most without muffling everything else like Sony's basic eq does. Then I started in on my test reel, and had to swap from Sony to Senn multiple times to make sure I wasn't hallucinating...Sony sound is clean, slightly warm, well balanced, with a surprisingly open soundstage. All in all it's better than average and generally inoffensive. ""Good enough"" for most people, myself included, or so I thought.Sennheiser sound is music injected directly into your brain. The highs soar, the bass thunders, and every drum beat is a Muay Thai whip kick to the cortex. The Sonys are simply laughable in back to back comparison testing.Even when listening to the few streaming services that support LDAC I can't tell any difference from APTx, and the Senn quality absolutely annihilates Sony regardless of source. After a while with the Senns I realized that there hadn't been a single cutout, something I had grown used to with the Sonys. Went running and immediately noticed the absence of the hollow thudding noise that accompanied every footfall while wearing the Sonys. The noise cancellation is close enough as makes no difference, and the ambient mode works well. All the automatic on/off, start/pause, etc stuff is there, and the Senns can connect to 3 devices at a time vs Sony's 2. Best of all: no pain, none. Where the Sonys are very comfortable at first and get increasingly uncomfortable over time, the Senns start off feeling slightly intrusive and then disappear from awareness entirely.Sound is very subjective so I can't promise that everyone will share my experience, but if you appreciate sound quality at all, you owe it to yourself to test them side by side. I honestly can't fathom how an professional reviewer could do so and not put the Senns on top by a wide margin. Having done so myself, I feel like I've been living in the Sony matrix for the last two years, and Sennheiser just unplugged me.","Reviewed in the United States October 10, 2023",AE7PVXZHCY3VWMP5HRD6H2SQEFDQ,1,14,Color: Black,Sony WF-1000XM5,0.22631759483454397,0.4610707559860102,Positive
R32VPS4DC4CEYI,B0C345M3T7,4.0 out of 5 stars A (slightly) flawed replacement,ihsan,4,"Let's cut right to the chase. Are they better than the WF-1000XM4?For me ... yes, with an asterisk we'll explore below.They are lighter and smaller than the XM4s, which is very welcome.The sound quality and ANC are ... probably better. It's too close. I couldn't really tell because...They come with absolutely terrible ear tips!The XM4s shipped with high-quality silicone tips in three sizes, as well as squishy memory foam ones in three sizes. The XM5s only come with a three-size assortment of thick, hard memory foam tips.Not only was I a fan of the silicone ones included with the XM4, but the foamies you get here are rather uncomfortable. They don't squish much, so they either natively fit your ears or they plain don't work well. I apparently needed a size in between M and S, as the M's gave me headaches from the girth, and the S's didn't seal, causing them to shift around while walking.Even the too-tight M's still produced a lot of the 'bump', 'bump', 'bump' noises you get when some part of the earbud/tip isn't perfectly stationary while walking. Lots of people can ignore this. I'm not one of those people.I tried my old silicone tips from the XM4s, and hooray for comfort! But the new buds sounded tinny with them, and the ANC suffered horribly. Clearly Sony retuned the software specifically for foamies.Eventually, I found a set of high-grade aftermarket foam tips which put everything in line. (I'm now using Airfoams Pro.) I never should have had to try multiple tip manufacturers to get top-grade earbuds to function like their predecessor (which worked perfectly right out of the box). This is a common problem reported by other reviewers, so prepare for the possibility for yourself.Overall, recommended.","Reviewed in the United States December 23, 2023",AFEWD5OIVTCGOQ44PWNT2JAFZIUQ,1,7,Color: Silver,Sony WF-1000XM5,0.06607359307359308,0.5083246753246753,Neutral
R2XHZGBRL7DIF3,B0C345M3T7,5.0 out of 5 stars Great headphones IF you know how to read,Adam F,5,"My review is going to upset some, but unfortunately after reading a few of the negative ones I felt the need to write my own.Background: after going through THREE pairs of Apple AirPod Pro 2 I decided to pick these up, and I have used them heavily over the last 24 hours (~3 hours of yard work in 90F+ heat, ~1 hour in the gym doing weights, ~20 minutes cardio running outdoors).TL;DR: Overall these headphones do what they claim, provide awesome sound quality (note: not an audiophile, audio geek or whatever) compared to my previous Apple headphones, and the ANC is spot on. YOU MUST USE AND CONFIGURE THE HEADPHONE APP to get the full functionality and experience with these headphones. Furthermore, you need to actually CONFIGURE these headphones. If you don't, you are missing 80% of the features (ANC, transparent mode, geofencing), at which point I just order a cheaper pair.Pros:- Sound quality is spot on for the price range.- Personally, compared to the Airpods the fit is a lot better. I do wear foam earbuds a bit with my actual noise cancelling headphones, so I am used to them and prefer them over the silicone ones.- WHEN CONFIGURED CORRECTLY, the ANC and transparent mode blow away the Apple Airpods. Hands down.- The app has some pretty sweet functionality, such as an EQ tutorial which allows you to finetune the sound to what you prefer without understanding frequencies, adaptive mode (basically detects what you are doing, walking or standing still, and either turns on ANC or transparent mode OR however you configure it), and there the gesture thing, although I think is a bit gimmicky, can be cool for some.- The actual controls are configurable on the headphones as well within the app, and they work sell with Mechanix gloves on.- Unlike others, I had no connectivity issues. Phone was in my left pocket, and earbuds were in. I am 6 foot tall, ~225lb for an example of distance between headphones and device.Cons:- You require the app. You have multiple people on here claiming things like ""oh there is no ANC"" or ""oh boy I can't get transparent mode to work"". Yea, because if you read the damn insert that came with the package you would realize the app is required. I will say that there is a TON of functionality that is baked in, but it is somewhat cumbersome to figure out. I am fairly technical, and I even had to Google a thing or two to find the appropriate settings.- The case feels cheap. The Apple Airpods, love them or hate them, has a premium feel to the case, whereas these headphones are not exactly the best.- The adaptive mode is bit of a PITA to configure, especially if you are using these for the ANC to ensure you aren't blowing your ears out. For example, if I whistle it thought I was talking and then would shut the music off. It finally learned that it wasn't me actually talking but whistling, but still an annoyance. Furthermore, the adaptive mode will turn on transparent mode IF you are running/walking, and this occurred when I was using my mower. Not the most pleasant feeling.","Reviewed in the United States September 4, 2023",AEVIODKPSLXV7IOKW2UGXLSPEDTQ,1,159,Color: Black,Sony WF-1000XM5,0.13297720797720797,0.4368945868945869,Neutral
R3K0LCJ8WSEFOW,B0C345M3T7,2.0 out of 5 stars Shockingly bad user experience...,G. Davis,2,"I've used many different brands of earbuds, and for the price, these are probably the worst I've used, to a degree I'm struggling to comprehend. Let's get one thing out of the way: they sound good. It's better than my AirPods Pro 2s. Everything else, and I mean everything else, is so much worse. Let's start at the top.These things are so slippery that I struggle to get them out of the case without dropping them. And for me, the shape is hard to get into my ears. Also, the case feels cheap. They charge $300 for these?Setup is a chore. You are required to use the app to access any of its features. And boy, is it a piece of work. From opening the app to first listening to anything took just over an hour. AN HOUR! You must log into a Sony account to get most of the high-end features to work, which is nonsense. And lord help you if you had a Playstation account 15 years ago. I appreciate the trouble Sony has gone to for security, but I had to do a 10-part captcha from hell twice to get into the account. And the translation to English in the app is poor at best, making the whole experience a head-scratching mess. The device pairing process is easy, however.The noise canceling is about as good as my 70-dollar no-name Chinese buds. Seems better at high-pitched things than general background noise, which is a strange feat as the former is much harder to pull off. I struggle to hear dogs barking, but my AC is as clear as a bell. The ambient pass-through is barely acceptable, not even in the same league as the AirPod Pros. Your voice tends to be over-amplified and slightly delayed, making talking to and understanding others a mess. The feature that mutes whatever you are listening to and turns off ANC when you start talking is hit or miss. It works about half the time when I start talking. The other half kicks on when any noise is picked up. Very annoying.Now, the reason I purchased these is Multipoint Bluetooth. This feature lets devices connect to multiple devices simultaneously and quickly switch between them. It's crucial for any work that has you bouncing between phone calls and working on a PC. Let me tell you, Sony's implementation is worse than useless. Can I connect to two devices? Sure. Can I stay connected to two devices? Absolutely not. When they are connected, does it switch seamlessly between the two? Also, absolutely not. If one is already making a sound, the other device can't be changed without silencing the first device. So, say you are listening to YouTube on your PC and get a call. To switch to the call, pause YouTube and anything else making sound, then answer the call. And about 50% of the time, it will switch. Otherwise, you have to change it manually. What is even the point? Even more fun is that the second device can't be switched to after some time, between 5 minutes and who knows how long, without manually going into settings and reconnecting first. Then you get another 5 minutes to a couple of hours of flaky ""fast switching"".The battery life is an actual lie. They claim 8 hours, but with all features turned off except playback, I got closer to 6. With ANC on, I may have gotten 4-5 hours. Each bud's battery seems to drain at different speeds as well. So, while one may have 10% left, the other is already dead.I would be less critical if these were $100 instead of $300. Crucially, though, even at $100, I would still return them. Other than sounding great, they are terrible to use. And for $100, I can get earbuds that sound just as good but aren't so finicky.In closing, I'm surprised Sony released such a poor product. They're so bad that it's tarnished my view of the company.","Reviewed in the United States November 15, 2023",AGPHPG2FTG2TRHFMZO7HGVSPKOIQ,1,68,Color: Black,Sony WF-1000XM5,0.060833333333333336,0.436329365079365,Neutral

R1PR7DVID3SN23,B0C345M3T7,3.0 out of 5 stars Good earbuds but disappointing overall,Steven H.,3,"First off I'll say that these are good ear buds. If you don't have something comparable and just want the latest and greatest then these will be a fine purchase. With that said however, they are a disappointing ""upgrade"" to previous generation and even somewhat for other sony true wireless earbuds.I try out a lot of earbuds. So I have tried a ton of stuff on the market from basic low end stuff to Bose QCs and the Sony offerings. I've always been a fan of the sony line of truely wireless earbuds since the first time I tried them. The sound profile has always been much to my liking and I've always felt like the noise canceling worked pretty well.These XM5s however just miss the bar. The bass from these is terrible. There are better bass notes on the lower priced Link Buds S. That said, the sound is generally clearer and higher quality than the Link Buds S otherwise. In fact other than the bass these are definitely some of the clearest and high quality sounding ear buds I have ever tried.As for noise canceling, I really don't know what Sony did here but it's seems to be a step down from the XM4s. If I compare them back to back sitting in the same location with the same ambient noises and noise canceling on, I hear a lot more sounds getting through on the XM5s. I can hear the AC unit in my room with them on where as with the XM4s I cannot. I'm positive I'm using the best ear bud fitment for me (as I said before I buy and try out a lot of different earbuds, so I know how to chose the correct bud size). I don't know if it's just an inferior chip with them trying to reduce size and extend battery, or if it's just bad firmware that needs to be patched.As for the fit / weight, they are more comfortable than the XM4s. I've worn them now for multiple 3 - 4 hour sessions and never had any discomfort from them. They are noticeably lighter and smaller than the XM4s. I will mention the glossy exterior and smaller size does make them a tad tricky to get out of the case. Could also be the magnet holding them in is stronger, but I've slipped trying to pull them out a couple of times now.Battery life I would call on par for modern day ear buds. Nothing amazing, but definitely would consider it good. Even after a 4 hour session with ANC on the lower of the two earbuds was still at 33%. They claim 8 hours but that is only if you have ANC and everything off.Overall as I said, these are good ear buds, just disappointing that the ANC seems worse, and the bass tones are so bad.","Reviewed in the United States September 25, 2023",AFH23JSGQS4ICPUR5H6CEEOC6RTA,1,54,Color: Black,Sony WF-1000XM5,0.11632809577254025,0.49011129816685384,Neutral
R3TYKIZ0H1F9BD,B0C345M3T7,"5.0 out of 5 stars Yes, It worth an upgrade!",Naji,5,"I was looking for the best noise canceling earbuds as I was tired of using a mediocre Galaxy Buds 2. So I started my research on earbuds that I can use for long hours and don't want to feel pain in my ears. Since I had Sony over-the-ear headset WH-1000XM4, I decided to go for Sony. I picked up XM4 earbuds from Amazon, connected with my Galaxy S23 Ultra and right away I was blown away by the crisp sound quality of XM4. I used it for a week, however, it was not comfortable at all. XM4 are bigger, heavier and the overall design is bulkier. So I returned those after getting pain in my ear canal and I completely dropped the idea of using in-ear buds. I bought Apple Airpod Pro 2 to counter the experience that I have just had with XM4 because it was cheaper than WF-1000XM5 and was highly rated. Though I am using Android flagship, but Apple Airpod Pro 2 can be configured using an ipad and macbook which I already have so I was able to configure it and use it with my Android phone. Other than spatial sound, I could use the Airpods pro 2 at their best. To my surprise, Airpods work amazing with Android espacially after I installed equilizers and increasing the bit rates. It even sounded better than when connected to an ipad. But within a week, I started to feel that it doesn't create an air tight seal to give the best music quality possible. I almost lost an Airpod without noticing that it fell out of my ear. Also while walking around, moving head too much, Airpods tend to get lose. I gave up on those also as it was not justified to pay premium price but not getting the features I need.So I went to the latest and greatest WF-1000XM5. These are smaller than XM4, lighter, made with premium material and you can tell right away that these earbuds are top notch. I connected my phone, enabled LDAP (Sony proprietary codec for bluetooth) and then up the bitrate in Android developers mode to maximum. Gave it some reverb and slightly increase the mids of XM5 and wow they sounded best of all that I have tried so far. It has memory foam tips, which are not that bad in the ear. I can wear those for hours without noticing that I have something in my ear. It creates a good air tight seal, ANC is amazing, sound quality is great. Some people have complained about ANC not be that good in crowded place, but in my use case I haven't encountered a situation where ANC is not up to mark. I personally think it was worth an upgrade from XM4 and it has given me better music on S23 Ultra than using Airpods. Sony knows how music sound great. These are earbuds until Sony makes the next upgrade XM6.","Reviewed in the United States September 12, 2023",AHBKZEGCOV7TPXD7B2SWJYD7SG3Q,1,27,Color: Black,Sony WF-1000XM5,0.2626656314699793,0.5246273291925467,Positive

The batteries always last a whole day, often well into a second day. A third day depends on use and to my memory would be around about 10%-ish percent battery life. Activating noise cancelling does not make a loud environment seem much quieter, but there is an obvious improvement to the sound quality. If I can't understand a podcaster over the environmental volume, noise cancellation has always been a reliable solution to clarify his voice. My only complaint is what to my layman ears a lack of bass. But that's to be expected from such a small device. As well that the microphone quality is quite disappointing for phone calls but functional, though its microphone cannot handle louder environments like the noise canceling can.

Listening to high quality streams and high bitrate audio, these sound nice. They sound a little better then my WFL900s but, they also fit the ear better and block outside sounds. The WFL900 have a pass-through hole, so outside sounds will get in your ear. The WF-1000XM5 are good. But are they $300 worth of good? No. Not by a long shot. Back when our phones had a wired connection I bought a really nice pair of Shure wired ear buds. These were so good, you could hear things you didn't hear before. The WF-1000MX5 probably will do the same thing, if the bluetooth audio wasn't compressed within an inch of its life. I have a current generation phone, so I can't imagine that is the issue. After trying 3 other ear buds, I've come to the conclusion that bluetooth ear buds are just OK. They will never be really good and you shouldn't really spend more money then you are comfortable with, considering you will probably crush or lose these within a year. Going back to my old Sony WFL900 until something else comes out. Hope this helps.","Reviewed in the United States April 4, 2024",AH7BFORFHOSR4NQ3ZP6U6YZP5HUQ,1,9,Color: Silver,Sony WF-1000XM5,0.3050806451612903,0.43483870967741933,Positive

Anyways, I was disappointed. These have better noise cancelling yes, but I miss the comfort of AirPods and the seamless integration with iPhone. One of the headphones will just not charge easily no matter how perfect I fit it in the case so after 2 or 3 times of popping these in to see one earbud had 0 charge, I gave up on these. I tried to return them but was outside of the 30 day window. I may have used these 6 times in total and have not used them since so I guess I'm stuck with them.

R2QOWD1ZKJN8Z,B0C345M3T7,4.0 out of 5 stars Solid earphones you will be happy,Symon,4,"The media could not be loaded. First let's just address price. Yes these are high because they are new. there are other options available but if you are looking then maybe you have the budget. Since the xm4's can be found roughly $99 used and 150 new, I would personally value these maximum $75 over current xm4 market prices. I'm just trying to compare apples to apples.Here is my rant about what sucks comparing these strictly to the xm4s.For a 2-3 yr wait for these...Sony could have done better with two design items, but more importantly, the app and features. Options for Pre-programed touch pad control have gotten slightly worse. yes worse. The startup tone cannot be disabled. It's a more pleasant tone than the 4's but yeah. at least I could turn them off. Volume control is both worse and better at the same time (in MY opinion) You have to rapid tap to increase/decrease. The glossy plastic on the earbuds are too slick. See video for the nudging requirements to remove the buds. especially if u got chonk sticks like me. The interface app is just getting out of control with the extra features and advertisements. I prefer simple.. Don't upgrade for these if you have the 4s. not worth it too me.My rant about what is better.Case size definitely got better, Earbud size is waaay more ergonomic. I got comfy with the xm4's, so they were good but this definitely stepped it up.. Music sound quality is noticably +1 over the xm4's version. The best way to describe it, is that every sound note is literally a hair more sharp and crispy. Play with the custom eq you will find something you like. other than that yea still top notch anc, good call quality connectivity etc... and all that extra stuff. You really start splitting hairs at some point for non professionals music people.Overall I'll give it 5 starts if you are upgrading from $30-$70 earbuds.If you are going from xm4's to xm5s (or any other high known flagship) I'd rate it 2 stars so save your money. (at least until they change the software features, IF they do)I don't have competitors buds to compare but I would estimate it at 3of5 stars.

If you think AirPods are the premium for sound and noise canceling, move along child. You're not here for the adult section.If you're here for actual sound, noise, canceling, audiophile level feeling, and solid improvements each update? Read on. I've had the last three editions, of the XM3, XM4, and XM5. I love the XM4 so much, I bought each color, one for work and one for everything else.First, the size of the case. This was one of my biggest gripes with the XM4. Obviously it was a huge difference from the XM3, but that's the first thing that you notice as soon as you see this with the XM5.The earbud pieces are quite similar, the essentially the ones fit the XM4s and the XM5, but they are much more hollow, and because of this you can wear them much longer compared to the XM4s, without having an earacheThe sound is superb. The additional codecs are quite impressive, and multi-point are even more impressive than they were when they came on to the XM4s.Somehow the already best in class (and yes I say that in comparison to all of the other headphones, because I have them all, AirPod pro 2s included) has somehow gotten even better. The other thing that I use constantly is transparency mode with one earbud in, so that I can walk around at work in a hospital and still hear everything around me while enjoying my music, which makes it a much more relaxing atmosphere.I've charged it once and since I've received them, and have used them pretty constantly all week. A few hours on and off, and I still have about 50% of battery life on transparency mode. I've used both earbuds with noise canceling for about 2 or 3 hours a day, while I do my notes, and just as comfortable.It's great for phone calls, and I love actually using the controls to control both the sound and the phone calls.All in all, this is the best headphones that I have both for work, play, and while steep in price, I don't think you will be disappointed.I know a lot of people feel that the app itself is overwhelming, but quite honestly, once you get the hang of it, all of your headphones sync the settings with only mild changes with each headphone. So all of my settings from the XM4 are past forward, and then the new settings that apply to these headphones, I can add in. Not all settings are required to be used, and I turned several of them off, including Google Assistant, additional notifications, etc.If you want a real world, real user, multi headphone enthusiasts review, this is it.

R264JXOICHBCP6,B0C345M3T7,"3.0 out of 5 stars Smaller and lighter than XM4, but not better!",C,3,"Firstly, they are smaller and lighter than the previous generation WF1000-XM4. They are slightly more comfortable in the ear, but not as easy to get a seal, since they can spin in your ear more freely. The battery life issues that plagued the previous generation (the reason Sony bought them back from me) are supposed to have been addressed, but time will tell. Active noise cancelling is again great, as long as you can get a good seal. The buds come with multiple sizes of foam and silicone tips. These are the good things.The bad:... the sound. This is a big one, and I am very dissapointed here. They may sound great to some, but comparing to all the buds I own - The WF1000-XM4, Denon Perl Pro, Galaxy Buds, Pixel Buds 2, they aren't as good sounding. I don't know what it is exactly, but the sound is way worse than the XM4. It sounds overproduced or artificial. It leaves me wanting for something more, something the XM4 gave me. I tried the customized sound profile in the app, but it doesn't seem to do much, and doesn't give the quality I am used to. If you crank the sound up they come alive a bit more, but they are too loud to listen to comfortably or for long periods.Overall they are not bad buds, and if you can catch them on sale they are worth a try, however, they did not deliver the sound I expect from Sony. I personally feel they put too much focus on making them smaller and lighter. These aren't earbuds that I would buy to go to the gym or run with, I bought them for the Sony sound quality, and unfortunately, this was a miss by Sony in my opinion. If you have high standards for accurate and lively sound quality, these may not be the buds for you.","Reviewed in the United States January 5, 2024",AFSKX25YXZFUYF2TECSS2OBUPI4A,1,2,Color: Black,Sony WF-1000XM5,0.2265972222222223,0.49076388888888883,Positive

Very annoying to be honest, compare to the last gen I changed left side as volume control, in which I can hold and adjust the volume, but this one you have to keep hitting it.About the comfort, they about the same, I can not tell the difference between each other.Overall if you buying this for gaming, or you are a customer representative at work need microphone a lot, it is kind worth buy it or upgrade from WF4, simply because you can turn off the sidetone on wf5.Besides that there aren’t noticeable or meaningful changes compare to the last gen.","Reviewed in the United States July 31, 2023",AELUYECRF5GZK2OZYGEIPMLXMGDQ,1,27,Color: Black,Sony WF-1000XM5,0.1335374149659864,0.38456632653061223,Neutral
RT61N0HBRPYVZ,B0C345M3T7,"3.0 out of 5 stars Poor fit, I guess",Clams,3,"I got these after reading good reviews and having connection problems with two different pairs of Bose QC ii earbuds. I had previously tried the xm4s, and they were good but too large for my ears and hurt after wearing them just 30-ish minutes. When I got these, I couldn't understand why the reviews had been so good. The ANC was just horrible. Definitely worse than the Bose and the XM4s. I've had them a couple of weeks and tried many different sets of ear tips and couldn't get any improvement. I mostly use earbuds at the gym, and with these, I could still clearly hear background noise and music, even over the sound of my own music. Sometimes the noise comes through so clearly that I can't believe the ANC is even turned on.Finally after two weeks using them, I tried pressing them further into my ears and holding them there. When I do that, the ANC is great, but they won't stay in that deeply unless I hold them, so I'll need to return them. Apparently these are just not a good fit for my ears and I can't get a decent seal.Other:*The multi-point connection is great and works really well. It's ridiculous that the Bose doesn't have that.*Battery life is as advertised.*These are much smaller and more comfortable than the XM4s. The case size in a lot smaller and convenient.*Having to tap four times to adjust the volume is stupid and annoying.*No ""find my device"" feature. I got a case and attached a Tile. Another ridiculous feature omission.*The earbud volume is not synced to the phone volume, at least not on my Pixel 7. This means that if I use the phone buttons to change volume, it will only change up or down to the point that the earbud volume is set at. If you want max volume, for example, you would have to max the volume on your phone and max it on the earbuds. The Bose were not like this. Adjusting the volume on the earbuds brings up the volume control on the phone.I decided to buy a used pair of the original Bose earbuds. I'd previously owned them and sold them when I got the Bose II. They are big and ugly, and the case is too big, but they worked properly without any of the issues or frustrations I've experienced with the Bose II and Sony XM4/XM5. (But I will say that I probably would have kept these xm5s if they had fit well enough for good noise cancellation.)","Reviewed in the United States September 25, 2023",AHDUO5GC5LHF4C5DJVUURKZMCY5A,1,0,Color: Black,Sony WF-1000XM5,0.12273629148629152,0.5587301587301587,Neutral

But...,Ryan Oswald,3,"All the reviews about how awesome these are once you have them in your ears are absolutely correct: if anything better has been developed yet I don't know about it.Unfortunately, all that effort spent on the performance left functionality up the proverbial creek sans paddle.Just putting these in your ears will result in your music turning on and off a dozen or so times. The controls alternate between being so sensitive a breeze changes the track to having to hit them with a hammer just to pause and un-pause.True, you can change the button pre-sets, but not in a meaningful way. You can basically turn them off so you won't turn them on off on off on off on off your music putting them in, but once you do, you can't turn on your music, so basically defeats the entire purpose.However, once you do, somehow, eventually, possibly get them in your ears and following reasonable commands.... that's some amazing sound quality.","Reviewed in the United States June 9, 2024",AHUJF5WK52NSU2OICXC37NIVU4DQ,1,0,Color: Black,Sony WF-1000XM5,0.23333333333333334,0.5216666666666666,Positive
RY2I7FXPDUKGT,B0C345M3T7,4.0 out of 5 stars *Early Impressions* A Marginal Upgrade To Their Already Great WF-1000XM4’s,April Villaaa,4,"Coming from the previous model, the WF-1000XM4, these feel pretty familiar. Although the shape has been slimmed down, the fit is pretty similar but slightly less bulky and yet pretty comfortable.They come with more ear tips allowing a tight seal for a wider variety of ears (SS, S, M, L) medium being the standard that come preinstalled out of the box.The default sound signature has changed slightly, but thanks to the Sony Headphones Connect app, there’s an 5 band equalizer with presets and their iconic “Clear Bass” slider for the bass heads. These earbuds can also produce more “rich” low bass frequencies. Allowing for nice sub-bass that does not sound muddy and overpowering, but rather strong and detailed (depending on your EQ of course).Ambient sound happens to be weaker and sounds slightly less natural compared to the AirPods Pro 2, but good enough. Noise cancelling has been improved with slightly better performance with sudden noises like bangs and clanks, and even better/noticeable improvement with voices, hums and rumbles.(PS: Ambient sound still sucks when it’s windy due to excessive wind-flap noise. But, wind reduction during noise cancelling has been improved!)Lastly battery. Which appears to be about the same as the last model (about 8 hours on the earbuds, 24 hrs with the charging case), but the charging of the earbuds in the case is much faster! 60 minutes of playtime from 3-5 minutes of charging is not too crazy of a claim.Now, keep in mind that the WF-1000XM4 had problems with battery malfunction. And although Sony did usually replace the many faulty units of the previous model, this is something to watch out for as there is no way to tell if they’ve improved it until a few more months have passed.Conclusion; If you’re currently an owner of the WF-1000XM4, I would wait for a bigger update. But if you’re upgrading from the WF-1000XM3 or even the AirPods Pro 2. This is a great product that will not leave you disappointed.Extra Features not tested:Multi-Device Connections, Head Gestures, Extensive Voice Call quality under difficult scenarios, In-device Voice Assistant.","Reviewed in the United States August 1, 2023",AF67MZXBRLZXOMSKSAMRGDWF72SA,1,30,Color: Black,Sony WF-1000XM5,0.10847832722832723,0.46201159951159954,Neutral
R3E1HECH05SPZ4,B0C345M3T7,3.0 out of 5 stars Overrated,E7,3,"I have the Sony WF-1000XM4 and now the XM5. The XM4 battery life is terrible. They have issues with those so don't get those. The XM5 noise cancellation is great and the music quality is good but I have a few complaints. The earbuds don't stay in my ear when using the original foam tips. It's annoying having your hands busy at work and feeling your earbud shifting about to fall out. I had to buy aftermarket foam tips. The sound could be better and it's probably due to the foam tips letting the sound out. My 2nd complaint is they're not loud enough. Even with aftermarket foam tips, the earbuds are just not loud enough. I work in a noisy environment and it's hard to listen to podcasts with these. The noise cancellation only works if you have both earbuds in. It sounds like it wants to work when using one earbud but only when there's a really loud noise. It cuts the music momentarily and goes back to letting all the noise in. It would really help if it would work with only one earbud in because I wouldn't have any problems hearing whatever I'm listening to. I hate the touch sensitive controls. I wish they had a physical button that gave me a clicky feedback every time I press it. There is a tone whenever you pause or skip but like I said, it's hard to hear in a noisy environment. Most of the time, I have to raise my volume to notice if it paused, skipped or didn't register me pressing the touch sensitive controls. I originally bought these to use while I'm at work but now I only use these at home. For work I use the Beats Studio Buds which are louder, stay in my ear (with comply foam tips), have great audio and have a clicky button for the controls. No more guessing if I pressed the button or not. With the Beats Studio Buds I can now listen to the same podcasts I couldn't hear with my XM5s in the same noisy environment. I just bought the Studio Buds + which have a better battery life than the 1st gen.

I got them setup and connected to my iPad Pro, iMac, iPhone, Apple Watch and PC laptop. After using them for the better part of the day I personally don't feel any new great sound breakthrough or anything along those lines. The WF XM4's had a great balanced sound quality that I loved and they were my 'go-to' earphones for everything, over my Apple AirPods Pro, Kilpsch earphones, Bose Sound Comfort, Jabras and Master & Dynamics. This great balanced sound quality only continues in the WF XM5s. The overall sound staging is wonderful. Some people might prefer more bass though or more sparkly highs but for me the WF XM5s strike a perfect balance. Putting aside the marginal audio improvements, the big thing for me though was the new size. They're much smaller than the large bulbous WF XM4s and that was the big reason I was looking forward to these new ones. And I'm quite happy to report the size is definitely a welcome change. The WF XM4s would always start to wiggle loose in my ears after extended use and after a while, they almost get 'pushed' out of my ears unfortunately. Sony also added a new size to the ear tips, a 'SS' size (super small?). So it's L, M, S and....SS. The ear tips are made of new material and is supposed to enhance the sound quality. Meh, I don't hear much difference personally. The housing of the earphone is different too....more glossy not a matte finish like the WF XM4s. Not sure whether I like this or not but they do look different and I always like the color contrast of the gold Sony branding and gold mic with the black color housing. The ANC and call quality in my opinion still doesn't match some of my other earphones unfortunately. Still overall I'm quite happy with the new version, mainly because the sound quality hasn't diminished and they're much smaller.

And with the app, you can dial it in even further. Fantastic.CONS:The stock silicone tips are both uncomfortable and a poor fit. I bought some aftermarket foam tips, and they're more comfortable. But this was where the STW4s won out -- they were like pillows in your ears. Even with the new ones, they still come loose more often than I'd like.The case is fine, but not befitting of $300 buds.

I have the WF and WH series going back to 1003 versions. I purchased these on day 1 mainly because my 1004s got wet and the case no longer holds a charge. For the first two months I was extremely disappointed - sound and ANC was SIGNIFICANTLY worse than the previous version. I know I have weirdly large ear canals and purchased my standard ear tip replacements but they just didn't work. None of the included ear tips worked - especially in my left ear. Eventually I just gave up and carried a separate battery backup for my 1004s.Recently I found a new ear tip vendor and purchased several options - memory foam, silicone, etc. I found that if I replaced the ear cup in the left ear with one in a smaller diameter but GREATER length it would fit well.With the fit finally sorted I started comparisons. Overall these are barely, marginally better than the previous version. It's not worth the extra cost, in my opinion. ANC has no noticable difference and overall sound response is basically unchanged with just a slight improvement in mid tone clarity.Get the 1004s and wait for the 1006s.","Reviewed in the United States November 30, 2023",AHGMP46KJI7DQAEIVU4WQKBXARVQ,1,1,Color: Black,Sony WF-1000XM5,0.05057720057720058,0.2766594516594516,Neutral

R2FG9RVBGOIB7W,B0C345M3T7,3.0 out of 5 stars Great headphones ruined by bad Bluetooth,Dale,3,"What’s great: Sound is fine. Noise cancelling is the best I’ve experienced. The touch controls are fine. Features are good: lots of modes, got an equalizer. The case is pleasantly small—I love it, it’s small enough to comfortably pocket. Battery life is fine.What’s not great: The actual earbuds are kind of big and frankly they hurt. To add insult to injury, they don’t seal in my ears, even with the largest tips. Sony, you need bigger tips. These ones are constantly threatening to fall out.WHY I RETURNED THEM: Another unusable Bluetooth multipoint implementation. I paired them to my iPhone and my Mac. Now my Mac is across the house and asleep. I pull the headphones out of my pocket to listen to my phone. Surprise! They’ve connected to my laptop. I can’t disconnect them from here. I can’t open them in the app. The app is VERY flaky on iOS, it connects to the headphones about 50% of the time. I literally can’t listen to my headphones that are in my ears from the phone in my hands because I’m now streaming silence from my laptop across the house.I know it’s a meme but… literally unusable in this case. If you’ve got a single device, go ahead and get these I guess. But for $300 I expected more. I’m now using the AirPod Pro 2s (for now). They are REALLY uncomfortable but at least I can *gasp* switch which device they connect to.","Reviewed in the United States February 5, 2024",AERXKHMKNYHULJ3YRXAWAGCX4NBA,1,2,Color: Black,Sony WF-1000XM5,0.23380952380952383,0.5285714285714286,Positive
R3L29RCDQOSFC5,B0C345M3T7,4.0 out of 5 stars A few questionable design decisions,George G,4,"The ANC, sound quality and battery life are all excellent. The fit is an improvement over the M4s (which I returned due to battery and connection issues). But I'm taking a star for a few questionable design decisions.First, the buds are quite slippery and difficult to remove from the case. I can see this being a problem after exercise or during rainy weather. Some matte texture would have helped. What's weird is that they make this smoothness a selling point in the marketing material. How much did they test these in the real world?Second, and possibly worse long term, the eartips have a mesh to prevent debris from getting into the buds, but that's it. There is no foam inside the buds. If you need replacement eartips in the future, you'll want to find tips that have mesh protection, but after a cursory search on Amazon I don't see many options with a mesh. Now maybe you're like me and happy with the included tips, but In my experience they will wear out. So unless Sony starts selling their own replacements, this was a bad decision.In general, it feels like two steps forward on fundamentals, one or two steps back on design even if they are more comfortable.","Reviewed in the United States December 7, 2023",AGEEJ2HE7XACHRCI4ZNNJGNO66GQ,1,1,Color: Silver,Sony WF-1000XM5,0.09880952380952382,0.5650793650793651,Neutral

These don't come loose when I work out, chew, walk, run, etc.I bought them when they went on sale for $50 off, and I see that they are priced even lower now ($26 less than the sale price).As to those who have complained that the magnets make them difficult to remove from the case, well, they need to read the instructions. You simply tilt each bud to the sides of the case, then lift them out. Simple.As much as I love these, they lost a star to one feature that is missing. The inability to program the button functions is frustrating. Four taps on the buds to adjust the volume?

The sound quality is very good, especially when I get a tight seal in my ears, which is not always easy. The LDAC codec does make a subtle difference in sound quality for the better. (Higher quality sound available on some Android decices.) My only complaint is that I would sometimes like them to be a bit louder than they are. My main genre of music is classic rock, hence wanting the sound a bit louder. I used the app to tweak the equalizer more to my liking.The active noise reduction (ANR) works quite well. I haven't had buds with ANR before, so I do not really have anything to compare it to, but they do a good job of drowning out most ambient sounds when engaged. I have not used them for more than about 3 hours at a time yet, so I can't comment on battery longevity.Would I buy them again? Good question. I probably would if the price dropped some.

It's easier to have a conversation with the noise cancelling ON!The battery life is fine, whatever, they charge quick and the left one dies faster than the right one.They slide out of my ears constantly, even with a great seal on foam tips I have to readjust a couple times an hourHuge regret purchase, wish I decided to do this review still within the refund window","Reviewed in the United States June 20, 2024",AERUSX2C2KHII7ERYUS56ZSZEG4A,1,1,Color: Black,Sony WF-1000XM5,0.17214285714285715,0.3456150793650794,Neutral
R1AROZI21BGFZM,B0C345M3T7,4.0 out of 5 stars A worthy successor to the XM4,Daniel,4,"While I believe the XM4s were better, these are definitely worthy of similar praise. They have amazing sound quality, awesome battery, a slim form factor, comfortable fit, and much more. I've never really liked their app, but that was true of the last generation. Just not very economically friendly. My only gripe with these earbuds is the noise cancellation. It's certainly better than most on the market, but it's noticeably worse than the last model from Sony.","Reviewed in the United States March 24, 2024",AFDEHL2BVW7L4RTGB2J6KFJZTPVQ,1,0,Color: Black,Sony WF-1000XM5,0.25532407407407404,0.5879629629629629,Positive
R2JROC4C7QI3R5,B0C345M3T7,5.0 out of 5 stars Very nice ear buds.,K. Lake,5,"I like that they actually work well when canceling noise. They work with my phone and tablet audio books. The ambient sound function does attenuate sound it lets through. I wish it would work with the TV but does not. I have not been able to get the left and right tap controls to work, but that is probably me. They work with the app so I can turn them off, or whatever. Off works well on the airplane. I had hoped that they would allow hands free operation from the phone. The phone rings thru and can be answered but to talk I have to hold the phone in front of me and talk into it. Over all, I like them.","Reviewed in the United States May 22, 2024",AGLXPBAJWERQQPEB2PVAYF7FPRGQ,1,1,Color: Silver,Sony WF-1000XM5,0.2836734693877551,0.4086734693877551,Positive
R2PFDTHZXD6F2A,B0C345M3T7,5.0 out of 5 stars Great sound,KrisTK,5,"Per all the other reviews, the sound is great. I’m still trying to get the fit to get the noise cancellation to work; the tips seem hard to me. My old 3’s did great in that respect.These do better connecting to everything and staying connected vs my 3’s. The charge lasts as listed, and quickly recharges in the case.","Reviewed in the United States June 21, 2024",AFHK3SH7NZ33U6KONJDYYEVM5Q3Q,1,0,Color: Silver,Sony WF-1000XM5,0.3240740740740741,0.4907407407407407,Positive
R2CG3WIXFKBB23,B0C345M3T7,"3.0 out of 5 stars Wonderful sound quality, help back by bad software.",Sam,3,"I actually returned this headset, the reason simply comes down to not being able to custom what the touch controls do in the software. I have Samsung Pro buds 2 which allow me to customize them anyway I see fit but this forces my to use a default config that is frankly poorly thought out. For the insane price this shouldn't even be an issue but here we are.The sound quality and noise cancelation is top notch truly is great.","Reviewed in the United States June 18, 2024",AGBWZLYJUDCT2WQZU5RVCQW7JXBQ,1,0,Color: Black,Sony WF-1000XM5,0.10444444444444445,0.5021031746031746,Neutral
R1LQPXS07VE34X,B0C345M3T7,3.0 out of 5 stars Not Great,CTX,3,"I'll try to make this as short of a story as possible. For a while, I've been seeking for the best/decent earbuds after my Pixel ones wore out. Multiple website reviews all directed me to these Sony WF-1000XM5. Thus, I purchased these earbuds and was greatly disappointed to some features/details that weren't mentioned on product pages or reviews:1) Degradable earbud tips - Yep, the ear pieces are super soft foam but biodegradable. I get the whole trying to limit waste in the environment, but if I'm spending $200+ on earbuds, I'd like for the material to last more than 6 months.2) Case felt like recycled hard foam - Same as above, for the price asked, it's just not right.3) Volume controls - This was the main thing that killed it for me. Gesture/Touch interface is terrible. To raise/lower volume, one must repeatedly tap the earbud four times, which only raises/lowers by one level. The app has options to change some gesture/touch but nothing for volume. It goes back to my previous nitpicks: If I'm spending way too much on headphones, I better be getting something near perfect.Sound on the earbuds were great, and the fit was the most comfortable I have felt in years. However, due to the three things mentioned above, the $250 pricetag was not worth it for me.","Reviewed in the United States December 27, 2023",AEEUHYIY5VJRYOKSKSJPFSHR4D7Q,1,2,Color: Silver,Sony WF-1000XM5,0.04540229885057472,0.39396551724137935,Neutral

R2K5N76Q348OZW,B0C345M3T7,"5.0 out of 5 stars Sounds amazing, good battery life, and ANC is almost perfect",John T. Layne,5,"These are my first actual pair of nice ear buds and they do not disappoint. I spent some time researching and eventually landed on these as my choice. ANC is about 95% blocking out all other noise, the features are great in the app to configure them, and so far the battery life is stellar. However, the sound quality is the most impressive by far and large. I walk in the gym on treadmills and I can't hear a large fan blowing directly at my head nor could I hear people talking around me, but as far as the audio I can hear rich bass and highs so well that even in previously viewed youtube videos I was hearing things I couldn't before. I also use them while connected to my computer via bluetooth while flying in the sim in VR. These things are incredible!The only drawback I will say is that to adjust the volume you have to repeatedly tap on the left or right bud and sometimes if it doesn't register a tap you may end up having them do one of the quick functions. This isn't that big of a deal for me though as I adjust my volume from my phone or computer.Also, if one bud is out you lose the functions that bud provides. So if the left bud is out I cannot toggle ANC, and if the right bud is out I can't stop playback. Not a deal breaker for me though.","Reviewed in the United States January 2, 2024",AEAOKLXNNRSNCEOBB7X6UJKGPGZA,1,1,Color: Black,Sony WF-1000XM5,0.20641025641025637,0.5059065934065935,Positive
